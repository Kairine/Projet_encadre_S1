The following article is from <A href="http://www.nogaymarriage.com/"><strong>NoGayMarriage.com</strong></A>. Many other articles   on sodomite marriage are available at this same website.
<H1>Gay Marriage: Why Would It Affect Me?</H1>
<H2>Ten Arguments Against Same Sex Marriage</H2>
(This is a synopsis of the new   book by Dr. James Dobson, Marriage Under Fire.)
<H3>Argument #1. Same Sex Marriage Decays Families</H3>
The implications for   children in a world of decaying families are profound. A recent article in the   Weekly Standard described how the advent of legally sanctioned gay unions in   Scandinavian countries has already destroyed the institution of marriage, where   half of today's children are born out of wedlock.
<p>It is predicted now, based on demographic trends in this country, that more   than half of the babies born in the 1990s will spend at least part of their   childhood in single-parent homes.  
<p>Social scientists have been surprisingly consistent in warning against this   fractured family. If it continues, almost every child will have several "moms"   and "dads," perhaps six or eight "grandparents," and dozens of half-siblings. It   will be a world where little boys and girls are shuffled from pillar to post in   an ever-changing pattern of living arrangements-where huge numbers of them will   be raised in foster-care homes or living on the street (as millions do in other   countries all over the world today). Imagine an environment where nothing is   stable and where people think primarily about themselves and their own   self-preservation.  
<p>The apostle Paul described a similar society in Romans 1, which addressed the   epidemic of homosexuality that was rampant in the ancient world and especially   in Rome at that time. He wrote, "They have become filled with every kind of   wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife,   deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant   and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they   are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless" (v. 29-31, NIV).  
<p>It appears likely now that the demise of families will accelerate this type   of decline dramatically, resulting in a chaotic culture that will be devastating   to children.  
<H3>Argument #2. Gay Marriage Will Lead to Polygamy</H3>
The introduction of   legalized gay marriages will lead inexorably to polygamy and other alternatives   to one-man, one-woman unions.
<p>In Utah, polygamist Tom Green, who claims five wives, is citing Lawrence v.   Texas as the legal authority for his appeal. This past January, a Salt Lake City   civil rights attorney filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of another couple   wanting to engage in legal polygamy. Their justification? Lawrence v. Texas.  
<p>The ACLU of Utah has actually suggested that the state will "have to step up   to prove that a polygamous relationship is detrimental to society"-as opposed to   the polygamists having to prove that plural marriage is not harmful to the   culture. Do you see how the game is played? Despite 5,000 years of history, the   burden now rests on you and me to prove that polygamy is unhealthy. The ACLU   went on to say that the nuclear family "may not be necessarily the best model."   Indeed, Justice Antonin Scalia warned of this likelihood in his statement for   the minority in the Lawrence case.10 It took less than six months for his   prediction to become reality.  
<p>Why will gay marriage set the table for polygamy? Because there is no place   to stop once that Rubicon has been crossed. Historically, the definition of   marriage has rested on a bedrock of tradition, legal precedent, theology and the   overwhelming support of the people.  
<p>After the introduction of marriage between homosexuals, however, it will be   supported by nothing more substantial than the opinion of a single judge or by a   black-robed panel of justices. After they have done their wretched work, the   family will consist of little more than someone's interpretation of "rights."  
<p>Given that unstable legal climate, it is certain that some self-possessed   judge, somewhere, will soon rule that three men and one woman can marry. Or five   and two, or four and four. Who will be able to deny them that right? The   guarantee is implied, we will be told, by the Constitution. Those who disagree   will continue to be seen as hate-mongers and bigots. (Indeed, those charges are   already being leveled against those of us who espouse biblical values!) How   about group marriage, or marriage between relatives, or marriage between adults   and children? How about marriage between a man and his donkey? Anything   allegedly linked to "civil rights" will be doable. The legal underpinnings for   marriage will have been destroyed.  
<H3>Argument #3. States Will No Longer Protect Marriage</H3>
An even greater   objective of the homosexual movement is to end the state's compelling interest   in marital relationships altogether. After marriages have been redefined,   divorces will be obtained instantly, will not involve a court, and will take on   the status of a driver's license or a hunting permit. With the family out of the   way, all rights and privileges of marriage will accrue to gay and lesbian   partners without the legal entanglements and commitments heretofore associated   with it.
<H3>Argument #4. Children Will Be Taught Perversion</H3>
With the legalization of   homosexual marriage, every public school in the nation will be required to teach   that this perversion is the moral equivalent of traditional marriage between a   man and a woman. Textbooks, even in conservative states, will have to depict   man/man and woman/woman relationships, and stories written for children as young   as elementary school, or even kindergarten, will have to give equal space to   homosexuals.
<H3>Argument #5. Children Will Be Placed in Gay Households</H3>
<p>







 From that point forward, courts will not be able to favor a traditional family   involving one man and one woman over a homosexual couple in matters of adoption.   Children will be placed in homes with parents representing only one sex on an   equal basis with those having a mom and a dad. The prospect of fatherless and   motherless children will not be considered in the evaluation of eligibility. It   will be the law.                    </p>
            <H3>Argument #6. Parents Will Be Reuiqred to Accept Homosexuality in Their   Children</H3>
            Foster-care parents will be required to undergo "sensitivity   training" to rid themselves of bias in favor of traditional marriage, and will   have to affirm homosexuality in children and teens.
            <H3>Argument #7. Gay Partners Will Burden the Government Entitlement   System</H3>
            How about the impact on Social Security if there are millions of new   dependents that will be entitled to survivor benefits? It will amount to   billions of dollars on an already overburdened system. And how about the cost to   American businesses? Unproductive costs mean fewer jobs for those who need them.   Are state and municipal governments to be required to raise taxes substantially   to provide health insurance and other benefits to millions of new "spouses and   other dependents"?
            <H3>Argument #8. Gay Marriage Will Spread Quickly to Other   Countries</H3>
            Marriage among homosexuals will spread throughout the world, just   as pornography did after the Nixon Commission declared obscene material   "beneficial" to mankind.11 Almost instantly, the English-speaking countries   liberalized their laws against smut. America continues to be the fountainhead of   filth and immorality, and its influence is global.
            <p>The point is that numerous leaders in other nations are watching to see how   we will handle the issue of homosexuality and marriage. Only two countries in   the world have authorized gay marriage to date-the Netherlands and Belgium.   Canada is leaning in that direction, as are numerous European countries. Dr.   Darrell Reid, president of Focus on the Family Canada, told me two weeks ago   that his country is carefully monitoring the United States to see where it is   going. If we take this step off a cliff, the family on every continent will   splinter at an accelerated rate. Conversely, our U.S. Supreme Court has made it   clear that it looks to European and Canadian law in the interpretation of our   Constitution.13 What an outrage! That should have been grounds for impeachment,   but the Congress, as usual, remained passive and silent.  
            <H3>Argument #9. Evangelism Will Be Hindered</H3>
                              Perhaps most important, the   spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ will be severely curtailed. The family has   been God's primary vehicle for evangelism since the beginning.
                              <p>Its most important assignment has been the propagation of the human race and   the handing down of the faith to our children. Malachi 2:15 reads, referring to   husbands and wives, "Has not the Lord made them one? In flesh and spirit they   are His. And why one? Because He was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself   in your spirit, and do not break faith with the wife of your youth" (NIV).  
                              <p>That responsibility to teach the next generation will never recover from the   loss of committed, God-fearing families. The younger generation and those yet to   come will be deprived of the Good News, as has already occurred in France,   Germany and other European countries. Instead of providing for a father and   mother, the advent of homosexual marriage will create millions of motherless   children and fatherless kids. This is morally wrong, and is condemned in   Scripture. Are we now going to join the Netherlands and Belgium to become the   third country in the history of the world to "normalize" and legalize behavior   that has been prohibited by God himself? Heaven help us if we do!  
                              <H3>Argument #10. The Culture Will Be Anti-Christian</H3>
                              The culture war will be   over, and I fear, the world may soon become "as it was in the days of Noah"   (Matthew 24:37, NIV). This is the climactic moment in the battle to preserve the   family, and future generations hang in the balance.
                              <p>This apocalyptic and pessimistic view of the institution of the family and   its future will sound alarmist to many, but I think it will prove accurate   unless-unless-God's people awaken and begin an even greater vigil of prayer for   our nation. That's why Shirley and I are urgently seeking the Lord's favor and   asking Him to hear the petitions of His people and heal our land.  
                              <p>As of this time, however, large segments of the church appear to be unaware   of the danger; its leaders are surprisingly silent about our peril (although we   are tremendously thankful for the efforts of those who have spoken out on this   issue). The lawless abandon occurring recently in California, New Mexico, New   York, Oregon, Washington and elsewhere should have shocked us out of our   lethargy. So far, I'm alarmed to say, the concern and outrage of the American   people have not translated into action.  
                              <p>This reticence on behalf of Christians is deeply troubling. Marriage is a   sacrament designed by God that serves as a metaphor for the relationship between   Christ and His Church. Tampering with His plan for the family is immoral and   wrong. To violate the Lord's expressed will for humankind, especially in regard   to behavior that He has prohibited, is to court disaster.

                                For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this;   Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

                              <p>5 &ldquo;If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies   and has no son, the widow of the dead man shall not be <EM>married</EM> to a   stranger outside <EM>the family;</EM> her husband&rsquo;s brother shall go in to her,   take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband&rsquo;s brother to her.</p>
                              <p>6 And it shall be <EM>that</EM> the firstborn son   which she bears will succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name may   not be blotted out of Israel.</p>
                              <p>7 But if the man does not want to take his   brother&rsquo;s wife, then let his brother&rsquo;s wife go up to the gate to the elders, and   say, &lsquo;My husband&rsquo;s brother refuses to raise up a name to his brother in Israel;   he will not perform the duty of my husband&rsquo;s brother.&rsquo;</p>
                              <p>8 Then the elders of his city shall call him and   speak to him. But <EM>if</EM> he stands firm and says, &lsquo;I do not want to take   her,&rsquo;</p>

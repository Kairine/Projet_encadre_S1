Why gay marriages should not have been legalised

                        First religious gay marriage

                                Quotes about
                                gay marriage

                          Gay marriage South Africa

                          First gay marriage on TV

                        First televised gay marriage

                              First gay divorce

   1) Being gay is not natural. Real South Africans always reject
   unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.
   2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that
   hanging around tall people will make you tall.
   3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy
   behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has
   legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.
   4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at
   all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and
   divorce is still illegal.
   5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were
   allowed; the sanctity of Britney Spears's 55-hour just-for-fun marriage
   would be destroyed.
   6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay
   couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to
   marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more
   children.
   7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight
   parents only raise straight children.
   8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours,
   the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's
   why we have only have one religion in South Africa.
   9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at
   home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to
   raise children.
   10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never
   adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars or
   cellphones.

   Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in his first interview since
   taking office in April that he supports a proposed change to the
   constitution to allow same-sex marriage.

   "I defend there being no kind of discrimination," he said, although he
   added that it is up to the Cuban people to decide whether to include
   the change. The interview with the Venezuela-based television station
   Telesur aired on Sunday evening.

   Cuba is currently drafting a new constitution that is being debated at
   community meetings throughout the Caribbean island nation. The document
   will replace Cuba’s Cold War-era constitution.

   Diaz-Canel, 58, joins Cuban lawmaker Mariela Castro in support of
   legalizing gay marriage in the country. Mariela Castro is the daughter
   of Raul Castro — Diaz-Canel’s predecessor and the current leader of the
   Communist Party — and the niece of Fidel Castro.

   At a news conference in May, Mariela Castro said she would push for
   same-sex marriage to be included in the country’s constitutional reform
   process, which began in July. She also spoke of the need for tougher
   sanctions for anti-LGBTQ violence, according to Latin American news
   outlet Telesur.

   Mariela Castro has been a longtime advocate for LGBTQ rights in Cuba
   and serves as director of the National Center for Sex Education, a
   Havana-based LGBTQ advocacy and educational organization. She also
   leads the annual march against homophobia and transphobia in Havana,
   and her status as a staunch supporter for LGBTQ rights was the subject
   of a 2016 HBO documentary, “Mariela Castro’s March: Cuba’s LGBT
   Revolution.”

Same-sex marriage is now legal in Australia

   THE final step to make same-sex marriage legal in Australia has now
   been completed with couples able to marry by January next year.

   SAME-SEX marriage is officially legal in Australia after the
   Governor-General signed off on the historic laws today.

   Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull visited Sir Peter Cosgrove in Canberra
   for the signing of the bill this morning — the last step to change
   Australia’s laws.

   “I assent to this Act ... the Act now passes into Australian law,” Sir
   Cosgrove said as he signed a copy of the bill.

   The government has set Saturday, December 9 as the date the new laws
   will take effect and the Attorney-General’s office has confirmed this
   means weddings can take place from January 9. This is because couples
   need to lodge a Notice of Intended Marriage one month before their
   ceremonies.

   Couples who got married overseas will have their unions automatically
   recognised under Australia law on Saturday.

   Ahead of the historic moment, an elated Mr Turnbull encouraged his
   fellow Australians to start making wedding preparations.

   “It is a big Australian hug for all same-sex couples, saying we love
   and respect you, now go out there and get married,” he told the Seven
   Network.

   The new laws cleared parliament unchanged on Thursday evening after a
   marathon debate lasting 56 hours and despite a push from conservative
   MPs for additional religious protections.

   Only four MPs in the House of Representatives voted against the private
   bill, a week after the legislation was agreed to by the Senate.

   Mr Turnbull described the postal survey on same-sex marriage as a
   game-changer for the issue, now resolved after years of debate.

   He criticised Labor for not progressing the matter when in office but
   said the victory now belongs to the whole parliament.

   The passage of the laws would not put religious freedoms at risk or
   traditional marriage, he insisted.

   “People that think gay people making a commitment is a threat to her
   marriage fails to realise that the real threat is lack of commitment,”
   Mr Turnbull said.

   A clearly emotional attorney-general shared a drink with Labor senator
   Penny Wong after the vote to celebrate.

   “To see the galleries of the House of Representatives just explode
   spontaneously was something that was unforgettable,” Senator George
   Brandis told ABC radio.

   “Of all the things I’ve done since I’ve been in parliament I think this
   is the one that will be most consequential.”

   Labor leader Bill Shorten said the new law spoke for a modern,
   “inclusive and fair” Australia.

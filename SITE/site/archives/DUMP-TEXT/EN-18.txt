Gay Marriage vs. American Marriage

   The gay advocates’ civil rights argument forgets what the Founders
   thought marriage is for.
   Kay S. Hymowitz

   The Social Order

   These days everyone has a strong opinion about marriage, but no one
   seems to be sure what it is, exactly. Is it a sacramental union? Is it
   a public recognition of a committed love relationship? Is it a state
   scheme for distributing health insurance and tax breaks? Or given what
   two eminent anthropologists writing recently in support of gay marriage
   in the Washington Post describe as a "startling diversity of socially
   approved forms of marriage," is the institution too varied to fit into
   a single, dictionary-neat meaning?

   The anthropologists are right about one thing: human beings have come
   up with almost as many ways of getting hitched as they have languages
   to tell mother-in-law jokes. Some cultures allow only monogamous
   marriage; some accept polygamy. In many cultures, the wife moves into
   her husband's family's home; in others, the husband moves into the
   wife's; in still others, they get a mortgage and move into their own
   two-bedroom ranch in Levittown. Though most cultures give husbands the
   primary responsibility for providing for the children, some make the
   wife's brother—the baby's uncle—responsible for providing the food and
   the bow-and-arrow lessons. Some cultures don't allow divorce; some
   allow divorce but not remarriage; some allow divorce if husbands fork
   over most of their life savings to the likes of Raoul Felder; and
   others let a guy say "I divorce you" three times before booting his
   wife out the door.

   This protean diversity is central to today's marriage debate. If
   marriage is, as these examples suggest, an eminently malleable social
   construct, why shouldn't society shape it any way it likes, especially
   by letting gays marry each other?

   But beneath all the diversity, marriage has always had a fundamental,
   universal core that makes gay marriage a non sequitur: it has always
   governed property and inheritance rights; it has always been the means
   of establishing paternity, legitimacy, and the rights and
   responsibilities of parenthood; and because these goals involve bearing
   and raising children, it has always involved (at least one) man and
   woman. What's more, among the "startling diversity" of variations that
   different cultures have elaborated on this fundamental core, our own
   culture has produced a specifically American ideal of marriage that is
   inseparable from our vision of free citizenship and is deeply embedded
   in our history, politics, economics, and culture. Advocates for gay
   marriage cite the historical evolution of that ideal—which we might
   call republican marriage—to bolster their case, arguing that gay unions
   are a natural extension of America's dedication to civil rights and to
   individual freedom. But a look at that history is enough to cast
   serious doubt on the advocates' case.

   Strange as it seems, America's founding thinkers were as interested in
   the subject of marriage as any of Fox TV's bachelorettes. Given the
   political experiment that they were designing, they had good reason,
   for they understood the basic sociological truth that familial
   relations both echo and shape the political order. "To the institution
   of marriage the true origin of society must be traced," James Wilson, a
   member of the Continental Congress and later a Supreme Court justice,
   wrote in 1790. Before the Revolutionary War, legal philosophers and
   statesmen like Wilson filled magazines and speeches with discussions of
   what kind of marriage would best live up to the principles of the new
   country. It's not surprising that they zeroed in on one quality in
   particular: self-government.

   The Founders did not sketch their ideas about marriage on a blank
   slate, of course. They brought to their task a set of traditional
   Western assumptions about the institution, and these assumptions
   remained implicit in their new ideal and still resurface in our current
   discussions. Given that marriage was originally a religious sacrament,
   the Founders understood that the institution retained, even in their
   secular republic, an element of spirituality, an assertion that man is
   something higher than the beasts and more than a merely material being.
   The ceremony confers a special, human dignity upon our relations. In
   addition, they understood that marriage is a contract, regulated by the
   laws and ultimately enforceable by the state, that spells out property
   relations between the spouses, as well as their inheritance rights and
   those of their children. Therefore, marriage is intrinsically a
   government concern.

   In addition to these time-honored beliefs, the Founders brought a more
   modern idea to the matrimonial drafting table. Like many of their
   educated contemporaries in Western Europe, they had come to think of
   marriage in a way congruent with emerging ideals of individual liberty
   and democratic equality. In the old world, marriage was originally a
   matter of caste, class, or clan. Courtship was closer in spirit to
   bartering than romance; young people were to be traded off by elders
   intent on solidifying family ties and merging family fortunes and
   acres.

   By the late eighteenth century, however, Western Europeans were
   increasingly emphasizing marriage as a love-match between two
   self-determining individuals. Young people were free to choose for
   themselves with whom to spend their lives, and love could transcend
   class barriers to recognize the intrinsic personal worth of the
   beloved. This is the lesson of the profoundly democratic novels of
   Samuel Richardson and Charlotte Brontë, in which the drama concerns a
   rich, well-born master coming to realize that he loves his servant,
   that she is a character of sterling worth, and that he should marry
   rather than merely seduce her. In the same vein, the novels of Jane
   Austen dramatize what she understood was turning into one of life's
   most momentous, morally fraught decisions. For if the young could
   freely choose their own spouses, they needed to do so wisely,
   transcending mere sexual attraction and judging their suitors' worth in
   the moral rather than economic sense. Even so, at the time of the
   Founding, these modern ideas were still more theory than practice in
   Europe, where arranged marriages remained the norm.

   The Founders wanted to clear away many of the traditions that had kept
   these democratic notions from taking firm hold in old Europe. American
   marriage would reflect American principles of liberty and
   self-government. Unlike the hordes of serfs, servants, and subjects in
   other parts of the world, American citizens were going to shape their
   own lives and determine their country's destiny. Just as citizens would
   be self-governing in the political realm, they would also choose their
   spouses freely. According to Nancy F. Cott's Public Vows: A History of
   Marriage and the Nation, the source for much of the history of marriage
   in America that follows, since the struggle against domination and
   coercion was the essence of the American nation, the young needed to be
   free from arranged marriages and the authoritarian fathers who
   contracted them. As historian Jay Fliegelman has observed, the American
   Revolution and the new Western seriousness about romantic love, which
   developed at the same time, both sprang from a heightened valuation of
   the ideal of self-determination.

   Essential as it was, the loving, self-chosen vow was only one
   ingredient in the recipe for self-government. Self-government also
   meant citizenly self-reliance. The Founders believed that American
   citizens should not only be allowed to run their own lives but should
   be capable of doing so and responsible for doing so. In order to be
   free from "authority in all its guises," as Jefferson put it, citizens
   had to be competent, industrious, self-sufficient, and virtuous. All
   these qualities were to be learned in the republican home: "The
   foundations of national morality must be laid in private families,"
   John Adams wrote in his diary in 1778.

   Here Adams was voicing an up-to-the-minute theory of the republican
   family. Political thinkers imagined the American family as a factory
   specifically designed to turn out self-governing citizens—something
   quite different from what other kinds of families did. They believed
   that the affectionate ties between spouses led to civic responsibility:
   marriage based on individual choice would promote trust and equality
   that could then be projected into public life. "In detaching us from
   self, [love] accustoms us to attach ourselves the more to others. . . .
   [T]he lover becomes a husband, a parent, a citizen," a 1791 essay in
   New-York Magazine put it. In addition, the Founders recognized, the
   colonists' pioneer past had already made the American family an
   unusually and dependably self-reliant and industrious unit, just as
   later, when the nation expanded westward, the frontier family became a
   byword for rugged and indomitable self-sufficiency.

   Most important, republican marriage provided the edifice in which
   couples would care for and socialize their children to meet the demands
   of the new political order. If republican marriage celebrated
   self-government, it also had to pass down its principles to the young;
   it was supposed to perpetuate as well as to embody the habits of
   freedom. So whereas in all Western societies, the state concerns itself
   with fostering the institution of the family because it is the
   mechanism by which the society reproduces itself, in America that state
   concern takes on a special urgency, because of child rearing's unique
   momentousness to the national project.

   The small size of American families helped here. As any soccer mom or
   dad knows, parents with two or three children can invest far more
   attention in each individual child than those with eight or ten. By the
   Jacksonian period, the size of American families began to shrink.
   According to Janet Brodie's Contraception and Abortion in
   Nineteenth-Century America, the number of children born to white
   native-born women decreased 49 percent in the nineteenth century, from
   an average of seven children in 1800 to 3.6 by 1900.

   Demographers usually explain the decline in fertility as the result of
   improvements in infant mortality rates and a shift away from a strictly
   agrarian economy, in which large families were an advantage, but it's
   also likely that republican parents were discovering that preparing
   children for self-government was a mammoth undertaking, more demanding
   than socializing children to thrive in more communal societies.

   Early republican child-rearing experts emphasized to American parents
   that they were responsible for creating independent, industrious, and
   resourceful future citizens. American children should be brought up to
   be active, observant thinkers. "All the faculties of a child's mind
   should be cultivated," wrote Lydia Child in Mother's Book; kids should
   develop "habits of attention and activity of mind."

   American theorists also encouraged parents to abandon the demand for
   absolute, fearful obedience that was a relic of the old world. Children
   preparing for life in the new country could not remain mere passive
   subjects within an old-world patriarchal family. Whippings and
   beatings, commonplace throughout much of the world, were to be used
   only as a last resort; punishment "should be threatened as seldom as
   possible, and next as seldom executed as possible," clergyman and child
   expert Horace Bushnell wrote in 1849. This kinder, gentler discipline
   was designed to get children to behave virtuously because they had
   internalized national values, not because they feared either external
   authority or the shame they would bring on their families.

   To hear foreign travelers of the early nineteenth century tell it, the
   republican couple maintaining the homestead or going to church with its
   republican offspring was noticeably different—though admittedly, there
   was a downside. British naval officer and author Captain Frederick
   Marryat wrote of a scene that he witnessed during a visit to the United
   States in 1839. He watched a three-year-old named Johnny, whose mother
   had called him to come in out of the cold. "I won't!" the boy answered.
   "Come, my sweet, I've something for you," his mother implored. "I
   won't," Johnny pouted. His father took the more patriarchal approach
   and ordered his son inside. "I won't," the child insisted yet again. "A
   sturdy republican!" the father exclaimed, smiling, to the captain, who,
   being from the old world, was standing aghast.

   The Founders probably didn't foresee republican children quite like
   Johnny, but such "sturdiness" may have been inevitable in families in
   which the young had some freedom to question authority. Marryat may
   have been disdainful, but other European observers of the new world,
   including Alexis de Tocqueville, were impressed by the egalitarian,
   youthful spirit of the American family, which they contrasted with
   their own stuffy, patriarchal households. Unlike "the respectful and
   frigid observances of aristocratic families," Tocqueville observed,
   democratic families enjoy a "familiar intimacy, which renders authority
   less absolute. . . . [A] species of equality prevails around the
   domestic hearth." The new political order was placing unprecedented
   emphasis on individual rights, personal choice, and equality; the new
   domestic order appeared to be doing the same.

   You won't hear much about this historical background in the current
   debate over gay marriage, but advocates certainly invoke fragments of
   the American past in their argument. They frequently compare the
   current predicament of gays with that of other minorities, particularly
   African Americans, in the days before they had full rights to marriage.
   History, they argue, shows us that marriage is a civil right that has
   expanded over time to include previously marginalized groups; gays now
   deserve those rights as well. "Throughout the history of Massachusetts,
   marriage has been in a state of change," a group of historians of
   marriage, family, and the law asserted in an amicus brief in the case
   that legalized gay marriage in the state. Gay marriage "represents the
   logical next step in this court's long tradition of reforming marriage
   to fit the evolving nature of committed intimate relationships and the
   rights of the individuals in those relationships." But detaching the
   "tradition of reforming marriage" from the multifaceted tradition of
   republican marriage not only starts history around 1968, but it also
   presents a seriously distorted picture of why the American government
   is in the marriage business at all.

   While gays often invoke the black/homosexual analogy to assert in a
   general way that anti-homosexual sentiments are as vicious and
   irrational as racism, gay-marriage advocates use the comparison much
   more specifically. Their most commonly repeated argument goes like
   this: denying homosexuals the right to marry whom they wish is little
   different from denying blacks the right to marry whites, an injustice
   written into many state law books well into the twentieth century. It
   was not until 1967 that the Supreme Court, in Loving v. Virginia,
   finally ruled that state bans on such intermarriage were a violation of
   the Fourteenth Amendment's equal-protection clause. "Marriage is one of
   the basic civil rights of man," Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in his
   decision, in words that have become a familiar refrain in the current
   debate. The court rested its decision on one important pillar in the
   sophisticated architecture of republican marriage: that marriage is a
   civil contract. If the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right of black
   citizens to enter into a mortgage agreement or take out a car loan, it
   certainly protects their right to marry whomever they choose. It is
   logically inescapable, gay-marriage advocates conclude, that the same
   goes for homosexuals.

   And it would be logical—if a pillar were the same thing as the whole
   building. That the state has an interest in upholding the civil rights
   of individuals who want to marry doesn't mean that that's the only
   interest it has in the institution. The state also has a strong—even a
   life-and-death—interest in marriage as the environment in which the
   next generation of its citizens is raised.

   An earlier chapter in the history of African-American marriage
   illustrates this point. After the Civil War, anti-slavery Republicans
   were alarmed by the promiscuity and rampant fatherlessness among
   ex-slaves, disastrous consequences of the institution's prohibition
   against slaves entering into marriage contracts. These abolitionists
   created the Freedmen's Bureau, in part as a federal marriage
   initiative: they wanted to encourage ex-slaves to marry and create
   stable families. Their aim wasn't primarily to ensure the civil right
   of blacks to enter into contracts of all sorts, including marriage;
   they believed, above all, that American-style marriage would help
   ex-slaves become responsible, self-reliant citizens who would rear
   responsible, self-reliant children. In light of this dual state
   concern—the rights of the couple and the promotion of self-governing
   families that would mirror and sustain the republic—the historical
   analogy between black marriage and gay marriage that the advocates
   posit makes no sense.

   In fact, gay-marriage proponents generally treat children as a
   distraction from the state's interest in marriage rather than crucial
   to it. They impatiently insist that history has settled the matter: it
   has definitively separated child rearing and marriage, demonstrating
   conclusively that marriage is a changing and elastic institution that
   can easily accommodate homosexuals. "When a third of children are born
   out of wedlock, when contraception and abortion are available on
   demand, when you have single-parent adoption legal in every state,"
   Jonathan Rauch, the author of the recent Gay Marriage, has opined, "the
   debate is over about detaching marriage from parenthood—indeed was over
   years ago." Andrew Sullivan, along with Rauch one of the most
   thoughtful and eloquent advocates writing today, agrees: the argument
   that marriage has anything to do with children, he says, "fails
   socially and culturally because in our culture at this time,
   procreation is not understood to be an essential part of what it is to
   be married."

   But it's worth considering just how recently—and how
   haphazardly—Americans closed "the debate . . . about detaching marriage
   from parenthood." For most of American history, republican marriage
   remained the reigning paradigm: a self-reliant and child-centered
   couple, who had freely chosen each other in a spirit of equality and
   mutual affection and who would pass on to their young not just property
   but also the qualities needed to live in freedom. That reign only came
   to an end in the late 1960s as divorce laws loosened and Americans
   began pulling off their wedding rings at record rates.

   Divorce is such a conundrum for the nation because it follows directly
   from American principles even while threatening to subvert them. During
   the Revolutionary era, marriage theorists understood that a nation that
   loves liberty had to tolerate some divorce; if it was a matter of
   principle that you chose to enter into wedlock, it was also a matter of
   principle that you had to have some way of choosing to get out, at
   least under some circumstances. A number of early writers—including
   Thomas Paine, whose problems with Mrs. Paine gave him a personal stake
   in the issue—urged Americans to take a tolerant approach toward the
   practice. Still, even though divorce was more accepted in this country
   than in many parts of the world, it remained rare, a last resort and
   one that worried people deeply. That was no longer the case by the late
   1960s, when squeamishness on the subject evaporated, the marital exit
   door flew open, and not only the battered and the miserable but also
   the merely unfulfilled came pouring out.

   This shift was a threat to republican marriage for reasons that went
   beyond a mushrooming population of newly single mothers scraping
   together funds to pay their rent or their babysitters, while their
   children trekked across the country to visit Dad every school vacation.
   The soaring rates of divorce signaled a fundamental transformation in
   the American idea of marriage. As Americans crowded into the divorce
   courts, they were casting aside the complex—and demanding—vision of the
   Founders. Marriage was becoming a minimalist institution; people now
   thought of it as an intimate relationship between two adults, having
   little to do with children and nothing to do with propagating the
   political and moral culture.

   This demand for a fuller recognition of the individual rights of
   spouses who sought divorce, along with the loosening relationship
   between child rearing and marriage—both necessary precursors for gay
   marriage—led inexorably to a further development. If marriage was
   simply a personal relationship between adults and had little to do with
   child rearing, Americans wondered, then what was the problem with a
   woman's having a baby if she wasn't wearing a ring? The answer could
   only be that there was none.

   What did the law have to say about this cultural revolution, given the
   state's interest in protecting marriage as the institution in which
   children are raised? The courts, in all their wisdom, decided that
   safeguarding marriage wasn't their job any more. In case after case,
   judges decreed that marriage was an ordinary civil contract and that
   marriage and child rearing were legally unconnected. Never mind that
   American law and policy had always accepted the traditional assumption
   that marriage laws centered largely on the relationship between
   generations. That was history. In the 1972 Stanley v. Illinois case, to
   cite just one of many examples, the Supreme Court decided that custody
   laws distinguishing wed and unwed fathers were "constitutionally
   repugnant." Fathers who had never married their child's mother should
   have the same rights as those who had. More recently, the prestigious
   American Law Institute recommended that state family law be updated to
   treat cohabiting parents as virtually identical to married parents in
   the event of a breakup. Sometimes parents marry; sometimes they don't.
   Why should the state care?

   Many have interpreted these legal innovations as part of the "long
   tradition of reforming marriage" in America that includes giving wives
   more rights over their own property as well as the repeal of
   miscegenation laws. They were no such thing. Unlike the changes in the
   treatment of blacks and women, which more fully expressed the Founders'
   ideals, the divorce revolution and the consequent change in thinking
   about marriage and child rearing represented a hard turn away from the
   original republican model.

   Widespread divorce and illegitimacy fracture into pieces the Founders'
   ideals of the self-governing family. Republican marriage had been a
   great experiment to harness a universal family bond into the service of
   a particular view of human freedom. Every society has some kind of
   marriage to tie parents and their offspring together, but only the
   American form of marriage strove to allow individuals the greatest
   amount of freedom within that tie. Little did the Founders expect that
   their most treasured ideal, freedom, would eventually be turned against
   the institution that they most prized for promoting that liberty by
   nurturing free citizens.

   No one knows the personal destruction wrought during this history
   better than the children who were its victims. For the generation now
   in its twenties and thirties, the sundering of child rearing and
   marriage was not part of the musty past; it was a bitter and lived
   reality. The world they grew up in was a scary, unpredictable place of
   self-absorbed adults who had a habit of disappearing, only to pop up
   from time to time with a stranger introduced as a new member of the
   family.

   That's not the world they want for their own children. Few of them are
   familiar with founding thinkers like James Wilson or John Adams, but
   they know enough to see that the family life the Founders had in mind
   was better than the one they endured. Yankelovich Partners found in one
   poll that almost three-quarters of Gen Xers—that is, adults in their
   late twenties and thirties—said they'd favor a return to more
   traditional standards in family life, though only a little over a half
   of their boomer parents agree. Knowing firsthand what it feels like
   when your father sits you down at the kitchen table and, unable to look
   you in the eye, says, "Your mother and I don't love each other any
   more"—and knowing from personal experience that their own capacity for
   stable relationships is shaky as a result—this generation questions a
   regime of drive-through divorces. A 1994 study by the National Opinion
   Research Center found that Gen Xers were the age group least likely to
   say that divorce is the best option for troubled couples. Young parents
   in their twenties and thirties are "nostalgic for the childhood that
   boomers supposedly had," as American Demographics has put it. "It's
   informed their model of the perfect, traditional marriage."

   So what are we to make of the fact that these mom-and-apple-pie young
   people tend to be more in favor of gay marriage than their parents and
   grandparents are? The great irony is that their traditionalism enlarges
   their sympathy for gays' hunger for ’til-death-do-us-part commitment;
   after all, that's what's they want, too. Odd as it sounds, gays and the
   children who grew up in single-parent homes share the experience of
   standing outside and looking longingly through the window at the
   peaceful, Norman Rockwell family reading or playing Scrabble in front
   of the fireplace. Rauch and Sullivan, in particular, have written
   touchingly of marriage as a solemn, even spiritual, union, a momentous
   public vow to another person that comes with profound responsibilities
   and aspires to transcendence. If you add together young people's
   earnest devotion to marriage and their interest in the civil rights
   movement (insofar as they have studied any American history at all,
   it's likely to begin with Rosa Parks and end with Martin Luther King),
   you have a generation for which gay marriage seems merely
   commonsensical.

   But what the young neo-traditionalists have trouble understanding is
   that their embrace of the next civil rights revolution, as many of them
   are inclined to see the fight for gay marriage, is actually at war with
   their longing for a more stable domestic life. Gay marriage gives an
   enfeebled institution another injection of the toxin that got it sick
   in the first place: it reinforces the definition of marriage as a
   loving, self-determining couple engaging in an ordinary civil contract
   that has nothing to do with children. That's no way for marriage to get
   its gravitas back. It is marriage's dedication to child rearing, to a
   future that projects far beyond the passing feelings of a couple, that
   has the potential to discipline adult passion. "The gravity of marriage
   as an institution comes from its demand that love be negotiated through
   these larger responsibilities [surrounding procreation]," Shelby Steele
   has written in response to Andrew Sullivan. Ignore those
   responsibilities and you get, well, you get the marital meltdown that
   this generation was hoping to transform.

   There is another reason to be skeptical about the idea that gay
   marriage is another step forward in an unbroken history of social
   progress. In fact, the fraying of the marriage–child rearing bond over
   the past decades has been a step backward: it has increased poverty and
   inequality. Too often, single-parent families, whether divorced or
   never married, are poor—and very much poorer than their two-earner
   counterparts. Instead of being the self-reliant units the Founders
   envisioned, too many of them are dependent on a powerful nanny state,
   either for welfare payments or for determining custody and tracking
   down child support. And instead of being the self-governing
   institutions of republican theory, nurturing sturdy, self-governing
   citizens, too many single-parent families, as many studies have shown,
   bring up kids who as adults do markedly less well on average in school,
   career, and marriage than those who grew up in intact two-parent
   families. As for children of never-married mothers: many of them make
   up the permanent underclass, and their high rates of crime, school
   failure, and welfare dependency are everything that the Founders
   expected the republican family to prevent. That so many of these
   families are black would make the Reconstruction architects of the
   Freedmen's Bureau weep.

   Think of the past several decades of high rates of divorce and
   illegitimacy as a kind of natural experiment testing the truth of the
   Founders' vision. The results are in: if we forget that marriage is
   both a voluntary union between two loving partners and an arrangement
   for rearing the next generation of self-reliant citizens, our capacity
   for self-government weakens.

   Alongside the familiar anthropological truth that marriage comes in
   many forms is another truth you don't hear about so much: different
   kinds of marriage—not to mention non-marriage—mold different kinds of
   individuals. The Founders envisioned a very specific sort of
   institution, one that would nourish a republic of equal, self-governing
   citizens. The evolution of marriage over the past 40 years has
   undermined that vision. Gay marriage threatens to sabotage it even

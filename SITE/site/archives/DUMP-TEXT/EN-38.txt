   JAKARTA, INDONESIA —

   Asia's youngest nation, East Timor (Timor-Leste), held its second
   annual LGBT pride parade in its capital, Dili.

   The small country cemented its role as a regional LGBT rights leader
   during a time when that community is under threat in many of its
   neighboring countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

   East Timor's pride campaign is notable for its broad base of support in
   a country of fewer than 1.3 million people. Last year, its prime
   minister, Rui Maria de Araujo, supported the fledgling movement,
   stating that "discrimination, disrespect and abuse toward people,
   because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, does not
   provide any benefit to our nation."

   This year, the campaign started early with a documentary film on LGBT
   acceptance within families that was released in April for an audience
   that included former president and prime minister Xanana Gusmao. It was
   filmed by the community advocacy group Hatutan.

   "Kinship is an important issue for the LGBT community in East Timor
   because it's such a small country," said Dede Oetomo, who founded the
   Indonesian gay rights advocacy group Gaya Nusantara.

   This year's parade, held July 20, had about 1,500 participants — up
   from 500 last year — and had "more participation from LGBT community
   members, especially the transgender and the lesbian community," said
   Natalino Guterres, an activist who spearheaded both parades. "It was
   great to see people of all generations coming to walk together."

   Small but powerful

   Pride 2018 was larger but also more complicated, said Guterres.

   "Last year, people weren't really sure what was going on, but this year
   they knew that it was an LGBTI pride parade. Some opponents are
   becoming more vocal … and some even threaten us by using phrases like
   'trash of the society,'" he said.

   Over the weekend, a local band led LGBT marchers in a traditional
   Timorese resistance song and participants spontaneously held hands,
   danced in a circle, and cried "tears of happiness," Guterres said.

   East Timor became fully independent in 2002, and many citizens still
   have memories of the nationalist struggle against Indonesia. The dance
   circle showed that the movement was "truly Timorese," said Guterres.
   "We showed that we are also a part of this country, and that our
   friends and families are also proud of us to come out to march with us
   in solidarity."

   Guterres was surprised by the turnout, and moved by one visitor in
   particular: his mother. He didn't realize she was there until after the
   fact, when friends informed him that they had seen her.

   "Just last year we had a discussion where [my parents] made me promise
   to be normal,'" he said. "So it was amazing to find out that she also
   went."

   Mixed fortunes

   Oetomo, who advocates for LGBT rights across Southeast Asia, said that
   East Timor activists have quietly been growing a movement for many
   years.

   "In 2002, protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation
   almost made it into the constitution," he said. "Timorese people have
   been freedom fighters, they know how to fight for their rights."

   Plus, said Oetomo, "they don't have the Islam factor, to be frank, like
   we do in Indonesia."

   save the young generation from LGBT people," outside the headquarters
   of a conservative Islamic group in Jakarta, Indonesia, March 17, 2016.

   Conservative Muslim groups like the Family Love Alliance and the
   Islamic Defenders Front have petitioned for same-sex intercourse to be
   outlawed and have conducted raids on private establishments,
   respectively.

   "The Catholic Church in Timor has never really opposed LGBT rights the
   way Indonesia's Islamists do," Oetomo said.

   Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch released a landmark report on
   the rapid decline of LGBT rights in Indonesia, East Timor's largest
   neighbor, which occupied the country for 22 years. Indonesian police
   conducted at least six raids on private gatherings that included LGBT
   people in 2016, and apprehended at least 300 LGBT people in 2017,
   according to the report.

   What the report shows, said Human Rights Watch researcher Kyle Knight,
   is how quickly the climate for LGBT rights can change in a nation.

   Before January 2016, "Human rights groups like us would hold up
   Indonesia as an example of pluralism … where governments didn't
   scapegoat and goad people using the LGBT community as a political
   pawn," Knight said. However, that was the month when several prominent
   officials made anti-LGBT remarks, sparking a nationwide moral panic
   that continues to this day. The situation for LGBT Indonesians declined
   precipitously within just two-and-a-half years, he said.

   But there are signs of change. Both Thailand and the Philippines may
   legalize same-sex marriage or partnerships, and LGBT rights are
   flourishing in Vietnam.

   "More and more of what is happening in Timor-Leste will be happening
   around the region," Oetomo said.

   "What Timor-Leste has accomplished is inspiring to all of us," he said.
   "Look, people in my organization are going to save money — in fact
   they've probably already started — and we will go to Dili [Pride] come
   2019!"

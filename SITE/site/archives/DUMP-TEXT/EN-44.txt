Chinese court dismisses same-sex marriage lawsuit

   New Delhi (CNN)India's Supreme Court has struck down a colonial-era law
   criminalizing consensual gay sex, overturning more than 150 years of
   anti-LGBT legislation.
   The court announced the landmark verdict in Delhi on Thursday, as
   jubilant crowds cheered and rights activists hugged one another,
   overcome with emotion.
   Section 377, an archaic law imposed during British rule that penalized
   intercourse "against the order of nature," had carried a maximum
   sentence of life imprisonment.

   The decision to repeal the law is a major victory for India's LGBT
   activists and supporters after years of determined struggle.

   "It's an emotional day for me. It's a mix of feelings, it's been a long
   fight," said rights campaigner Rituparna Borah. "There was not enough
   media or society support earlier but we have it now. People will not be
   seen as criminals anymore."
   Though the law was rarely enforced in full, lawyers argued that it
   helped perpetuate a culture of fear and repression within the LGBT
   community.
   A change in legislation will "create a space of freedom where you can
   start expecting justice," Danish Sheikh, a law professor at Jindal
   Global Law School and LGBT advocate, told CNN.

Long battle

   Thursday's historic ruling is the culmination of a lengthy and often
   fraught legal battle for equality in a country where homosexuality
   remains taboo.
   In 2009, the Delhi High Court ruled that the ban on consensual gay sex
   violated fundamental rights. The decision, which only applied to the
   Delhi region, was quickly overruled by the Supreme Court in 2013,
   following a petition launched by a loose coalition of Christian, Hindu
   and Muslim groups.
   In its 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court said that only a "minuscule
   fraction of the country's population constitute lesbians, gays,
   bisexuals or transgenders" and it was therefore "legally unsustainable"
   to repeal the act.
   During the latest hearings, lawyers representing more than a dozen gay
   and lesbian Indians questioned the constitutional basis of that earlier
   ruling.

   "It was a wrong judgment. It was not legal and it was based wrongly on
   the tenets of the constitution," said Colin Gonsalves, one of the
   lawyers representing the current group of petitioners.
   That case was strengthened last year, when the Supreme Court moved to
   uphold the constitutional right to privacy.
   The ruling, which declared sexual orientation to be an "essential
   attribute of privacy," helped galvanize campaigners.
   "Last year's ruling eviscerated the 2013 judgment," said Gonsalves.
   "There is no issue now. There is not much left to argue," he added.

     — Anna Isaac (@anna_isaac) September 6, 2018

   Opposition to moves to overturn Section 377 had rested predominately on
   religious and moral objections. In an interview earlier this year,
   lawmaker Subramanian Swamy, a prominent member of the ruling Bharatiya
   Janata Party (BJP), described the legalization of gay sex as a "danger
   to national security" and "against Hindutva."
   Hinduism has traditionally maintained a flexible, non-prescriptive view
   of sexuality. However, in recent years hardline Hindu groups have taken
   a more conservative approach.
   In the run up to the judgment, the BJP refrained from taking a public
   stand, deferring instead to the court.

Dehumanizing colonial law

   Out of the estimated 48 former British colonies that criminalize
   homosexuality, 30 still have laws based on the original colonial
   anti-LGBT legislation, according to Lucas Mendos, co-author of the 2017
   International LGBTI Association "State-Sponsored Homophobia" report.
   In the case of India, the original British law had remained in place
   more or less unchanged since it was introduced by British colonizers in
   the 1860s.
   According to India's National Record Bureau, more than 2,100 cases were
   registered under the law in 2016. India did not maintain a separate
   database of prosecution under section 377 until 2014.
   Arif Jafar, one of the current group of petitioners whose case the
   Supreme Court ruled on, was arrested in 2001 under Section 377 and
   spent 49 days in jail.

   Jafar now runs an informal support group in the northern state of Uttar
   Pradesh. The group, named "Trust," provides counseling, support and
   sexual health services to gay and transgender persons.
   In his petition, Jafar described the experience as dehumanizing and a
   violation of his fundamental rights. He also alleged that he was beaten
   and humiliated every day because of his sexuality.
   Campaigners in India pointed out that the law didn't only trap members
   of the LGBT community in the closet, it also invited other forms of
   discrimination, providing a cover for blackmail and harassment.

   "The constant fear of 377 we have felt will not be there for the coming
   generation," said Yashwinder Singh, of Mumbai-based LGBT rights group
   The Humsafar Trust.
   "Laws getting passed is one thing but changing the society is a big
   challenge," said Singh of the court's decision, Thursday.
   "Our work has started multifold now. We have to go and talk to people
   and change their mindset so that they accept every human as one."

     We join the people of India & the LGBTQIA+ community in their
     victory over prejudice. We welcome the progressive & decisive
     verdict from the Supreme Court & hope this is the beginning of a
     more equal & inclusive society. #Section377

   Following the announcement Thursday, the Congress Party, the country's
   main opposition, posted a message of congratulations on social media,
   welcoming the "progressive and decisive verdict" from the Supreme
   Court.
   As supporters celebrate the decision, activists will now be shifting
   focus to the broader issue of equality.

   "The next step is to start looking at issues of rights. Right now, it
   is just decriminalizing," Anjali Gopalan, founder of the Naz
   Foundation, which has spearheaded the fight against Section 377, told
   CNN.
   "The right that every citizen of the country should have access to and
   should not be taken for granted. Like the right to marry, the right to
   adopt, the right to inherit. Things that no one questions and that are
   clearly denied to a certain section of citizens."

Conservative Case for Gay Marriage

   “It became a cascade.” Dale Carpenter, a friend who e-mailed those
   words from Minneapolis, was writing about the unexpectedly lopsided
   vote for same-sex marriage in the Minnesota House last week (the state
   Senate approved it Monday, and the governor has signed it), but he
   might have been writing about the whole marriage movement.

   This month, Rhode Island and Delaware approved gay marriage. In June,
   the U.S. Supreme Court could restore it in California. If that happens,
   nearly 30% of the population will live in gay-marriage states.

   The cascade extends beyond marriage. America is rethinking its whole
   relationship with its gay citizens. This month, a poll by ABC News and
   The Washington Post found not only a 55% majority supporting marriage
   equality, but also even bigger majorities in favor of allowing openly
   gay Boy Scouts and opposed to banning gay Scout leaders. As for NBA
   center Jason Collins’ public announcement that he’s gay, it isn’t even
   controversial: It enjoys 68% approval.

   To understand why the public is breaking so fast for same-sex marriage,
   look not at “blue” (Democratic-leaning) states that recently approved
   it. Glance instead at deep-red South Carolina.

   There, on the same day that Delaware’s Senate passed marriage equality,
   the voters of the first congressional district sent former Republican
   governor and congressman Mark Sanford back to the House seat he
   occupied in the late 1990s.

   Now, this is not a man who has done right by marriage. Rather, he used
   it as a doormat. As governor, Sanford took a mistress, then disappeared
   for days on a visit to her in Argentina and lied about it. He lost his
   job and his marriage. But last week, the voters chose to overlook both
   his infidelity and his mendacity. They even overlooked Sanford’s
   putting his mistress (now fiancée) onstage at a campaign event with his
   14-year-old son, whom news accounts described as “visibly
   uncomfortable.”

   The voters of South Carolina are entitled to shrug off Sanford’s
   connubial escapades, but many other people notice a conservative double
   standard. No matter how hard gays work to be true to our life partners,
   we don’t qualify for marriage. But no matter how shabbily straights
   treat their vows, they qualify not only for marriage but also for
   Congress.

   When millions of Americans see straight people busting up marriages
   while gay people struggle to form them, they draw the obvious, and
   correct, conclusion. America needs more marriages, not fewer. The
   threat to marriage in the USA today comes not from gays’ trying to
   marry but from straights’ failing to get married and stay married.

   Researchers find that blue states have lower rates of divorce and teen
   pregnancy than red states do. “If you’re looking for solid marriages,”
   as the (conservative) New York Times columnist Ross Douthat has
   written, “head to Massachusetts, not Alabama.” Why? Gay marriage
   probably isn’t reducing straight divorce rates, at least not much. But
   it is part and parcel of a re-commitment to family values, not a flight
   from them.

   Same-sex marriage is socially conservative in that sense — and in a
   deeper sense, too. The movement is about equality and rights, yes, but
   it is also about responsibility and obligation. Marriage joins couples
   not just in a contract with each other but also in a pact with their
   community, their kids, their God and millenniums of custom. Gay and
   lesbian Americans yearn for those bonds.

   The father of conservatism, Edmund Burke, famously said society is “a
   partnership not only between those who are living, but between those
   who are living, those who are dead and those who are to be born.” In
   seeking marriage, gays are asking to join Burke’s mighty stream of
   tradition. They are asking to be constrained, not liberated: to be tied
   to a commitment larger than themselves, larger even than each other.

   That is why same-sex marriage is cascading. The public looks at
   marriage equality and sees the greatest social conservative movement of
   our time. And, at least outside South Carolina, it looks at Mark
   Sanford and sees something else.

Congress in 2019: The challenge of left-behind places

   Nathan Allen, 65, poses for a portrait in front of the motorhome where
   he sleeps in a homeless RV and tent encampment near LAX airport in Los
   Angeles, California, United States, October 26, 2015. Allen lost his
   job as a handyman, and so couldn't afford to pay the rent for his
   apartment. Los Angeles is grappling with a massive homelessness
   problem, as forecasted El Nino downpours threaten to add to the misery
   of thousands of people who sleep on the streets. Mayor Eric Garcetti
   has proposed spending $100 million to combat the problem in the
   sprawling metropolis but stopped short of declaring a state of
   emergency. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson PICTURE 16 OF 17 - SEARCH "NICHOLSON

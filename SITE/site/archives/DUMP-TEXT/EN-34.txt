   An MP who has backed jailing gay people for life was welcomed to a
   glittering Downing Street reception - and even spoke in the UK
   Parliament.

   Uganda's Jovah Kamateeka was among more than 100 female MPs from five
   continents who descended on Westminster last week for the Women MPs of
   the World Conference.

   In a speech during the conference, pioneered by veteran Labour MP
   Harriet Harman and held in the House of Commons chamber, Ms Kamateeka
   boasted Uganda's constitution "guarantees human rights".

   She was also invited to a reception in No10 where Theresa May told
   delegates: "We're helping give women a greater voice."

   But now the Sunday Times has revealed Ms Kamateeka as a supporter of
   Uganda's homophobic Anti-Homosexuality Bill.

   The 2014 law was originally dubbed the "Kill the Gays Bill" due to a
   clause allowing the death penalty, which was dropped.

   Despite being watered down, the Bill toughened up anti-gay laws
   allowing life imprisonment for so-called "aggravated homosexuality".

   Uganda's constitutional court eventually struck down the anti-gay law
   in August 2014.

   But Ugandan Parliamentary records show Ms Kamateeka - who leads the
   Parliament's human rights committee - defended it.

   She said in April this year: "We stood firm and passed the
   Anti-Homosexuality Bill in this House. It was only the courts of law
   that nullified our actions. As for us, we had passed the Bill into
   law."

   She added: "God created man and woman for posterity.

   "If we allow that men will marry men and women marry women, there will
   be no children and we will see the end of the world sooner."

   And she said: "We should say no to bad practices and we should say no
   to practices and values that are not Ugandan and practices and values
   that are not African.

   "We must be able to stand firm.

   "That Bill should come back and we pass it because we must stand firm
   for who we are."

   Last week's groundbreaking conference was co-hosted by Harriet Harman
   and Penny Mordaunt, the government's equalities minister.

   A UK government source confirmed all the MPs who were invited to
   Parliament were also invited to the Downing Street reception.

   A government spokesman said: "We are clear that homophobia in all its
   forms is completely unacceptable.

   "Getting more women into politics gives a voice to women and girls
   around the world to enable them to fight for their rights, creates
   female role models and leads to legislation and work which tackles
   gender inequalities and discrimination."

   A No10 source insisted Jovah Kamateeka was not in one of the groups of
   women formally introduced to Theresa May during the reception.

   A government spokesman added: "This government has been clear about the
   need to reform legislation that, in many parts of the world, still
   criminalises same-sex relationships and we have offered our support to
   member states seeking to reform such outdated legislation.”

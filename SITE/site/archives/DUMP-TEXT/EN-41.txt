     * Indian gay sex ruling

   country anymore"

   In a historic decision, India's Supreme Court has ruled that gay sex is
   no longer a criminal offence.

   The ruling overturns a 2013 judgement that upheld a colonial-era law,
   known as section 377, under which gay sex is categorised as an
   "unnatural offence".

   The court has now ruled discrimination on the basis of sexual
   orientation is a fundamental violation of rights.

   Campaigners outside the court cheered and some broke down in tears as
   the ruling was handed down.

   Although public opinion in India's biggest cities has been in favour of
   scrapping the law, there remains strong opposition among religious
   groups and in conservative rural communities.

   But this ruling, from the top court, is the final say in the matter and
   represents a huge victory for India's LGBT community.

   One activist outside the court told the BBC: "I hadn't come out to my
   parents until now. But today, I guess I have."

What have the judges said?

   Thursday's decision was delivered by a five-judge bench headed by
   India's outgoing chief justice Dipak Misra and was unanimous.

   Reading out the judgement, he said: "Criminalising carnal intercourse
   is irrational, arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional."

   Another judge, Indu Malhotra, said she believed "history owes an
   apology" to LGBT people for ostracising them.

   Justice DY Chandrachud said the state had no right to control the
   private lives of LGBT community members and that the denial of the
   right to sexual orientation was the same as denying the right to
   privacy.

   The ruling effectively allows gay sex among consenting adults in
   private.

What is section 377?

   It is a 157-year-old colonial-era law which criminalises certain sexual
   acts as "unnatural offences" that are punishable by a 10-year jail
   term.

   The law punishes, in its own words, "carnal intercourse against the
   order of nature with any man, woman or animal".

   While the statute criminalises all anal and oral sex, it has largely
   affected same-sex relationships.

   Human rights groups say police have used the statute to harass and
   abuse members of the LGBT community.

'Recognising everyone's right to love'

   Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi

   Even though it was rarely invoked when it involved consenting adults,
   section 377 could be - and was sometimes - used as a tool for
   harassment. It is not surprising then that campaigners are describing
   the verdict as a "new dawn for personal liberty".

   But in a largely conservative India, where leaders of all religions
   have consistently opposed gay sex, it will still be a while before
   attitudes change and the community finds full acceptance.

   But laws almost always play an important role in changing mindsets, and
   by recognising the community's right to love, the Supreme Court has
   restored the dignity denied to them for a very long time.
     __________________________________________________________________

How did we get to this point?

   It's been a tortuous route. A bid to repeal section 377 was initiated
   in 2001 and was batted between court and government until 2009, when
   the Delhi High Court ruled in favour of decriminalisation.

   Several political, social and religious groups then mobilised to
   restore the law and in 2013 the Supreme Court struck down the High
   Court ruling.

   Anti-section 377 activists then submitted a "curative petition" - a
   formal request to review an earlier court order perceived as a
   "miscarriage of justice" - and in 2016 the Supreme Court decided to
   revisit its ruling.

What has the LGBT reaction been to the latest ruling?

   One of joy given that the community has fought vigorously to strike
   down the law.

   change although more needs to be done

   Equal rights activists had argued that the very existence of such a law
   was proof of discrimination based on sexual orientation.

   LGBT activist Harish Iyer told the BBC: "I'm absolutely elated. It's
   like a second freedom struggle where finally we have thrown a British
   law out of this country... I think the next step would be to get
   anti-discrimination laws in place, or anti-bullying laws."

   Messages of support were posted on Twitter, including from film
   director Karan Johar:

     We are witnessing history being made. Hats off to all my #LGBT

     in the world that criminalises #homosexuality - thank you for that.

How have political parties reacted?

   The governing BJP party has said it would leave the decision to the
   Supreme Court.

   However, one of its members said he was disappointed with the verdict.

   Subramanian Swamy, known for making provocative comments, said: "It
   could give rise to an increase in the number of HIV cases."

   Meanwhile, the main opposition Congress party has welcomed the ruling,
   saying they "hope this is the beginning of a more equal and inclusive
   society".

   The UN has also welcomed the ruling, saying "sexual orientation and
   gender expression form an integral part of an individual's identity the
   world over".

What else was said in the ruling?

   The court said other aspects of section 377 dealing with unnatural sex
   with animals and children would remain in force.

   The judges also explicitly said that they only ruled on the
   constitutional validity of section 377 and were not looking at it in
   terms of other rights such as those related to marriage or inheritance.

   It remains too early to say what this will translate to in the longer
   term.

   Author and commentator Sandip Roy told the BBC that although the ruling
   was a cause for celebration, there were still hurdles to overcome, and
   a need for anti-discrimination laws.

   "I think we would be foolish to think that this is the end of the
   fight," he said.

Where is homosexuality illegal?

   The 2017 report from the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans
   and Intersex Association (Ilga) lists 72 countries and territories
   where same-sex relationships are still criminalised, although that
   includes India before its latest ruling.

   Most of them are in Africa, the Middle East and other parts of south
   Asia.

   The report said homosexuality could still result in the death penalty
   in eight nations.

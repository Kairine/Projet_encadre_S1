Two in Three Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage

   by Justin McCarthy
   Two in Three Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage

Story Highlights

     * 67% of U.S. adults say gay marriages should be legally valid
     * New high in support for gay marriage in Gallup's trend
     * Democrats remain more in favor than Republicans

   WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Sixty-seven percent of Americans support same-sex
   marriage -- the highest level in Gallup's trend. In each of the past
   three annual polls, Gallup has recorded three-percentage point
   increases among Americans who say same-sex marriages should be legally
   valid. The current figure is up 40 percentage points from the 27% who
   supported gay marriage when Gallup first polled on the question in
   1996.
   GayMarriageSupport

   These data are from Gallup's annual Values and Beliefs poll, conducted
   May 1-10.

   Some of the increases in support may be due to greater numbers of
   lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) adults getting married in
   the U.S. Using data for all of 2017, Gallup has found that more than
   10.4% of LGBT adults are married to a same-sex spouse. This means that
   Americans are more likely to know someone who has married a same-sex
   partner, and the visibility of these marriages may be playing a role in
   overturning some folks' previously held opposition to their legal
   status.

   Gay marriage became legal nationwide in 2015 upon the Supreme Court's
   Obergefell decision. This came more than a decade after the first
   state, Massachusetts, had legalized gay marriage. In the years leading
   up to the decision, a patchwork of state laws were created for and
   against same-sex marriage.

   Democrats Reach New High in Support for Same-Sex Marriage

   Democrats remain the most likely to support gay marriage among party
   groups. The 83% of Democrats in favor of legally recognized same-sex
   marriages is the highest level of support recorded for this group.

   Democrats are nearly twice as likely as Republicans to support legal
   recognition of gay marriages -- less than half of the GOP favors legal
   gay marriage (44%). The latest figure for Republicans' views on gay
   marriage is similar to the 47% recorded in 2017. The GOP has seen
   growth in the percentage of Republicans who favor legally recognized
   gay marriage over the years, but has yet to reach majority support.

   Meanwhile, independents' opinions on the issue are closer to those of
   Democrats. Currently, 71% of independents say gay marriages should be
   recognized by the law as valid, matching this group's previous high
   from last year.

   Bottom Line

   With the third anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision nearing and
   no formidable opposition trying to undo gay marriage's legality, it's
   likely that the percentage of married LGBT adults in the U.S. will
   continue to grow as new generations of same-sex couples enjoy their
   newfound rights.

   The trend toward increased public support for same-sex marriage could
   very well continue, given that there is still room for increased
   support among Democrats and independents. Reaching a national consensus
   on the issue would depend more on greater acceptance among Republicans,
   who remain mostly opposed to legally recognized same-sex marriages.

   In addition to the general trend toward greater acceptance of gay
   marriage, the same-sex weddings taking place across the country may be
   softening opposition among some Americans who once feared for what
   legalization would bring. But now that it's been legal for nearly three
   years -- and even longer in certain states -- some opponents to gay
   marriage may be rethinking their previous opposition.

   Americans have changed their minds on the legality of other issues as
   well. Gallup's trend on support for legalization of marijuana has
   largely mirrored its trend on legalization of gay marriage. On both
   issues, support gained steadily in the 2000s before reaching majority
   level in the 2010s.

Survey Methods

   Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews
   conducted May 1-10, 2018, with a random sample of 1,024 adults, aged 18
   and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
   For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of
   sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All
   reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for
   weighting.

   Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 70%
   cellphone respondents and 30% landline respondents, with additional
   minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular
   telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.

Looking Into What Americans Mean by "Working Class"

   by Frank Newport

   Some Americans may literally define the "working class" as those who
   are working, rather than as a position in the socioeconomic hierarchy.

Jordan Peterson's Views on Gay Marriage and Child-Rearing Are Dumb

   I dunno, looks like a cultural Marxist conspiracy to me...
   Love wins? I dunno, looks like a cultural Marxist conspiracy to me...

   Last night professor Jordan Peterson—daddy of all lobsters, Kermit of
   all frogs, palest of the spiders crawling around on the Intellectual
   Dark Web—stopped by The Moore for the second time since May. I didn't
   attend the lecture because I wasn't invited, but I do want to celebrate
   his departure. Since it's #pride this weekend, and since Slog is
   appropriately gay themed this morning, I thought it might be nice to
   briefly review Mr. Peterson's ideas about gay marriage and gay
   child-rearing. He's a clinical psychologist, after all, so maybe he has
   some interesting things to say about those subjects.

   Surprise! He doesn't.

   Let's begin with the most recent of the two videos I'll discuss. It was
   posted in early May of 2018, and it's called "Thoughts on Gay People
   Raising Children." When asked what he thinks about gay people raising
   kids, he says "I think the devil's in the details to tell you the
   truth."

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPtZ-u78hDc

   Peterson ultimately offers his blessings, but only under the condition
   that the gay couple "accept the fact that it's necessary for kids to
   have models of both sexes," believe deep in their hearts that "the
   sexes are different" in the first place, and realize they have a
   "tremendous responsibility" to provide for their children "what it is
   they would get in the classical human unit," which he describes as
   "father, mother, child." He specifically seems most worried about one
   or the other parent not taking on the father's role, which he claims is
   to initiate "rough and tumble play with the kids."

   So Peterson approves of you lesbian ladies adopting children, but only
   if one of you promises to put on the pants and throw the kid into the
   lake, a role he thinks you might not naturally perform due to your sex.
   And you gay mens can raise babies all you want, but only if one of you
   plays the role of the nurturing Yin chaos mother.

   Peterson might be worried about the fates of kids raised by gay
   couples, but an overwhelming number of other scientists are not. Only
   four of 79 studies surveyed by Columbia Law School suggested that kids
   raised by gay parents faced any adverse effects, but "all four took
   their samples from children who endured family break-ups." Over at the
   Guardian, Nick Evershed cites two other reviews that support the
   conclusion that kids are just as well off being raised by gay parents
   as they are by straight parents.

   But this question of gay couples raising kids doesn't happen in a
   vacuum, it happens in a country with an adoption crisis and a broken
   foster care system. We need gay couples to adopt children if we want to
   help more kids out of foster homes and into stabler situations. But
   Peterson is so obsessed with enforcing gender norms in parenting that
   he doesn't even think about this larger issue.

   Now, should gay people even get married in the first place? Though it
   seems like a pretty settled subject for the majority of Americans, even
   in 2017 Peterson still had some concerns.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4jef2C4T1_A

   "That's a really tough one for me. If the marital vows are taken
   seriously, then it seems to me that it's a means whereby gay people
   could be more integrated more thoroughly into standard society, and
   that's probably a good thing. And maybe that would decrease
   promiscuity, which is a public health problem, though obviously that's
   not limited to gay people," he says.

   Seems like he's into it for all the wrong reasons, but whatever, I
   don't always require purity of motive. But then in the video Peterson
   makes a little turn. He describes gay marriage as a wedge issue, and
   says it isn't obvious to him that "that legalizing gay marriage has
   done anything to decrease the demands that the radical left neo-Marxist
   types are placing on traditional society." You see, he's "concerned
   about the undermining of traditional modes of being, including
   marriage, which has technically and historically been a union between a
   man and a woman fundamentally for the purpose of raising children in a
   stable...environment."

   Again, Peterson's so obsessed with his weird little worldview that he
   sees gay marriage not as a fight for equal treatment under the law, not
   as a fight to claim next of kin so you can be in the hospital room when
   your partner is sick and dying, not as a fight to be just as miserable
   in love as straight people in marriages, but as one more milestone in a
   vast neo-Marxist conspiracy to erode "traditional modes of being."

   For the last time: this ~*free thinker*~ is not to be taken seriously.
   His ideas are "dangerous," but not in a cheeky contrarian way. If
   people adopted Peterson's ideas on LGBTQ issues, gay couples wouldn't
   be able to adopt children, and they might not even be seen as couples
   in the eyes of a law.

   But more than "dangerous," Peterson's ideas are boring, tedious,
   retrograde, and confused. He's a tradition-humping reactionary crank
   feeding off of the "Make the Present the Past Again" sentiment driving
   some of the worst impulses in the country right now.

   He's been roundly and thoroughly skewered by writers who've spent lots
   of time with him and by writers who haven't. But he's also been
   glorified as a savior of not-just-white-men on the internet. I'm
   sympathetic to readers who say Peterson's books saved them from the
   precipices of far right, but he doesn't seem to be pulling them back
   that far.

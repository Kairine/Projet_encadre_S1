These Asian Countries Are The Most Likely To Follow In Taiwan's LGBT Rights
Footsteps

   Proponents of legalizing same-sex marriage in Taiwan hope other
   governments in Asia will follow their lead. Taiwan’s Justices of the
   Constitutional Court cited “freedom” and “people’s right to equality”
   when it said Wednesday the law should allow same-sex marriage and told
   parliament to make sure of it. Taiwanese LGBT groups are wondering now
   who else in the region might follow when their homeland officially
   becomes Asia’s first place to allow same-sex marriage.

   "I believe the influence will be quite deep, and we'll see if
   activists in other countries can push their governments, give the
   governments more pressure," said Chien Chih-chieh, secretary general of
   the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights.

   The short answer to who's next: Thailand and maybe Cambodia.

   First let’s look at the rest.

   Authoritarian countries are unlikely to legalize same-sex marriage in
   full because they restrict civic activism that would give rise to an
   LGBT advocacy movement. Those advocates often press governments to
   allow same-sex marriage, if you look at the 20 countries worldwide that
   are OK with it now. Authoritarian states in Asia mean China, Laos,
   North Korea and probably Singapore. Some of those places are socially
   conservative anyway. Vietnam legalized same-sex marriage in 2015 but
   never followed up with enforcement.

   Countries with strong monotheistic religions are also unlikely to
   approve same-sex marriage laws because churches oppose the idea.
   Indonesia and Malaysia, though democratic, live largely by the rules of
   Islam. The same religion anchors much of South Asia and the Middle
   East. About a quarter of South Koreans believe in Christianity of the
   sort that sticks close to the idea of one man, one woman per marriage.
   Despite earlier momentum in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte
   said that as the leader of a largely Catholic country he opposed the
   idea, according to the American advocacy group Human Rights Watch.

   Then there's Japan. Japan lacks a “multicultural” component of its
   democracy, says Jens Damm, associate professor in the Graduate
   Institute of Taiwan Studies at Chang Jung University in Taiwan.
   Taiwan’s LGBT movement took shape in the 1990s as politicians elevated
   the cause of multiple non-mainstream groups as a way of distinguishing
   the island from its political rival China.

   But Thailand once stood a chance of beating Taiwan as the first place
   in Asia with a full-blown same-sex marriage law and someday it might
   take up the cause again.

   Scholars and LGBT activists in the Southeast Asian country known for a
   thriving LGBT scene had drafted legislation five years ago and no
   organized opposition surfaced, the international law firm G.A.M.
   Alliance says on its website. A senior legislator said at the time much
   of the country’s parliament, being mostly older people, was too
   conservative to pass the law. The bill eventually went on hold due to
   political instability, according to the website PinkNews. In theory it
   could resurface. As a possible precursor, Thailand passed the Gender
   Equality Act in 2015 to punish discrimination based on gender identity
   and sexual orientation, the news website says.

   Another likely spot is Thailand’s neighbor Cambodia. The country in
   2011 repealed a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, and news
   reports say influential authorities including the late king Norodom
   Sihanouk have favored a follow-up law. Still, no one in the Cambodian
   government has made the bold move.

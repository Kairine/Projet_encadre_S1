   SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A Latin American human rights court said on
   Tuesday that countries in the region should legalize same-sex unions,
   endorsing a growing push for marriage equality despite opposition from
   the Roman Catholic Church.

   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights’ decision came in response to
   a petition submitted two years ago by Costa Rican president Luis
   Guillermo Solis, who had vowed to increase rights for lesbian, gay,
   bisexual and transgender people in the majority Catholic country.

   A number of Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, do not
   allow same-sex marriage. However, that trend is changing and in recent
   years same-sex couples have been allowed to marry in Argentina, Brazil,
   Colombia, Uruguay and some parts of Mexico, despite church opposition.

   The Inter-American Court, based in Costa Rica’s capital San Jose, said
   the countries that it oversees should treat same-sex couples “without
   discrimination,” ensuring that they receive the same family and
   financial rights as heterosexual couples.

   It also recommended that these rights be ensured through temporary
   decrees while governments pursue permanent laws.

   Costa Rica’s government celebrated the decision, saying that lawmakers
   would take steps to adopt the court’s criteria “in its totality.”

   “The court ... reminds all states on the continent, including ours, of
   their obligation and historical debt toward this population,” Costa
   Rica’s vice president Ana Helena Chacon said at a press conference.

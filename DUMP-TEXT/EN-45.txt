Thousands of Chinese activists renew push for same-sex marriage

   Unlike neighboring Taiwan, whose recent decision to give gay couples
   marriage rights gave a boost to the LGBTQ movement across Asia, China
   has not budged.

   BEIJING - Chinese activists are rallying in the thousands to renew a
   push for same-sex marriage, making use of a rare window of opportunity
   to suggest revisions to a draft piece of legislation to include legal
   protections for the gay community.

   After decades of Communist prudery about sex of all kinds, lesbian,
   gay, bisexual and transgender Chinese have in recent years been openly
   tackling bureaucracy, legal uncertainty and entrenched social norms to
   assert their place in society.

   But unlike neighboring, democratic Taiwan, whose decision last year to
   give same-sex couples the right to marry gave a boost to the gay rights
   movement across Asia, China has not budged.

   Two years after a Chinese court rejected his application to be legally
   married, Sun Wenlin is trying to galvanize the LGBTQ community by
   asking people to propose amendments to a draft civil code en masse.

   The code, a piece of landmark legislation expected to be passed in
   2020, was released last week by China’s parliament for two months of
   public comment.

   The code makes changes on issues including sexual harassment, divorce
   and family planning, but does not further the rights of the LGBTQ
   community, Sun told Reuters.

   Earlier this week, Sun posted on his WeChat account a guide for how to
   submit revisions to write the legalization for same-sex marriage into
   the code.

   Sun’s post went viral and started trending on the Twitter-like Weibo,
   with related hashtags being viewed 50 million times. Signatories to
   Sun’s campaign for same-sex marriage legalization, launched last year,
   jumped from around 5,000 to over 20,000 in a day, he said.

   “I did not want to be reconciled to watching this law sit there
   silently without anyone paying attention,” he said.

   “We don’t know how long we would have to wait for the next change to
   submit opinions on the civil code.”

   The chance that suggested revisions to dozens of provisions will be
   accepted is “close to zero,” Sun said, but he is hopeful that
   discussion can push forward legal recognition.

   The civil code drafting process can help protect LGBTQ rights in areas
   like childbirth and employment, according to Zhu Bao, a Beijing-based
   lawyer.

   “Discussion of the provisions that have an impact on the legitimate
   interests of the community will make lawmakers face up to the existence
   of gender minorities,” he said.

   Reuters was unable to locate contact details for parliament’s Standing
   Committee, which is in charge of legislation.

   Individual legislators have occasionally in recent years proposed
   legislation during China’s annual meeting of parliament in March to
   legalize same-sex marriage, without success.

   Despite thriving gay scenes in many big cities and growing awareness of
   LGBTQ issues, the community has repeatedly had to face-off with China’s
   censors in recent months. There are no laws against same-sex relations
   in China.

   A ban — then reversal — of LGBTQ content by Weibo in April, followed by
   censoring of gay-themed content during the Eurovision Song Contest in
   May, have fueled fears of a growing intolerance.

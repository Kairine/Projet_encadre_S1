Cuba's draft constitution opens path to gay marriage

   HAVANA (Reuters) - The draft of Cuba’s new constitution opens the path
   to same-sex marriage, a government official said on Saturday, which
   would make the country that once persecuted homosexuals an unlikely
   leader in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.

   In the early years of Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, many homosexuals
   were sent to correctional labor camps, part of an institutionalized
   homophobia for which Castro later apologized.

   Yet Communist-run Cuba has made great strides over the past decade on
   LGBT rights, approving sex-change operations and banning workplace
   discrimination, partly thanks to the high-profile advocacy of Castro’s
   niece Mariela Castro.

   Proposals to recognize same-sex unions had stalled in view of the slow
   legislative process and lingering stigma in the macho society.

   That will start to change with the new constitution that will replace
   Cuba’s 1976 Soviet-era Magna Carta, the secretary of the council of
   state, Homero Acosta, told lawmakers on Saturday.

   The draft, elaborated by a commission headed by former President Raul
   Castro - Mariela Castro’s father - defines matrimony as between two
   individuals rather than between a man and a woman, he said.

   “The possibility of marriage between two people strengthens our
   project’s principles of equality and justice,” Acosta told lawmakers,
   adding that further legal changes would be needed to allow for gay
   marriage.

   The move reflects a trend in Latin America where same-sex couples have
   been allowed to marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and some
   parts of Mexico in recent years, despite church opposition.

   The battle has not yet been won however, Cuban LGBT rights activist
   Isbel Diaz Torres cautioned on social media.

   While the national assembly is expected to approve the draft
   constitution this weekend, it will then be submitted to a popular
   consultation, and final draft will be put to a national referendum.

   “We will continue in the streets until the final process of the
   constitutional reform,” said Diaz Torres. “And after the constitutional
   modification has been approved, we must ensure that same sex marriage
   is approved.”

   Grassroots campaigns for and against gay marriage have made it the most
   broadly debated proposed constitutional modification.

   Five evangelical denominations shared a statement on social media last
   month declaring marriage “exclusively the union of a man and a woman,
   according to the Bible.”

   Churches also plastered neighborhoods with anti gay marriage posters
   such as one reading “I am in favor of the original design - the family
   as God created it,” showing a heterosexual couple with a boy and a
   girl.

   LGBT rights activists fought back with their own posters such as one
   reading “I am in favor of Cuban design - a very original family,”
   showing a panoply of different family configurations including same-sex
   unions.

State Same-Sex Marriage State Laws Map

   In a landmark ruling issued in June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
   the Constitution allows for same-sex couples to marry, effectively
   overturning remaining restrictions in place in states.

   Prior to the ruling, 37 states and the District of Columbia had
   legalized gay marriage: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
   Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
   Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New
   Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
   Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont,
   Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

   Most other states had enacted constitutional or statutory bans on
   same-sex marriage, known as "Defense of Marriage" Acts. The following
   map shows state laws prior to the Supreme Court ruling:

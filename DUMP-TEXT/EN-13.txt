Taiwan group fighting gay marriage legislation seeks referendum on issue

   TAIPEI (AFP) - Conservative campaigners on Tuesday (Aug 28) threw a
   roadblock in the path to legalising same-sex unions in Taiwan,
   proposing a public vote on the issue and saying any reforms would
   jeopardise "family values".

   Taiwan's top court ruled in May 2017 that preventing same-sex marriage
   was unconstitutional and gave a two-year deadline for its legalisation
   - which would make the island the first place in Asia to do so.

   But there has been little progress on the issue since then, with
   President Tsai Ing-wen saying society is still divided on the issue.

   The anti-gay marriage Happiness of the Next Generation Alliance
   submitted a referendum petition to election authorities on Tuesday to
   try to prevent the civil code from being amended to recognise same-sex
   partnerships.

   If successful, the move may instead require a separate law to be
   enacted for civil unions between same-sex couples - a move that gay
   marriage campaigners say would be discriminatory and offer fewer legal
   protections.

   "The bottom line of basic family values shouldn't be overturned,"
   alliance spokesman Tseng Hsien-ying told reporters after the petition
   was brought to the election commission.

   "The collapse of the family system will deal a huge blow to society."

   Last year's court decision did not give specific guidance on how
   same-sex relationships should be legislated.

   Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has openly supported the legalisation of
   gay marriage, but her majority government has been accused of dragging
   its feet on implementing the change.

   The petition collected more than 678,000 signatures. If vetted and
   approved by the Central Election Commission, the referendum will be
   held to coincide with local elections in November.

   The group said it would also lodge two more petitions with the
   commission later on Tuesday.

   One would remove same-sex education from the school curriculum, while
   the other redefines the civil code's definition of marriage as being
   between a man and a woman.

   The commission said it had a number of other referendum proposals to
   process first and would handle the group's petition later on Tuesday or
   Wednesday.

   Gay rights campaigners are also rushing to gather signatures for their
   own referendum proposal, which would ask the public to vote to enshrine
   same-sex marriage in the civil code.

   "We have to let those in power see very clearly the wishes of the
   people, and we hope they can amend the legislation as soon as
   possible," said Ms Miao Bo-ya, a key activist behind the campaign.

   Referendum proposals in Taiwan are put to a public vote if they are
   supported by 1.5 per cent of the electorate - a little over 280,000
   signatures.

   Plebiscites are legally binding and the government is obliged to
   propose laws that reflect their results.

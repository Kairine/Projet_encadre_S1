Mapping anti-gay laws in Africa

Tightening laws and increasing punishments

   Legal rights are diminishing for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
   and intersex (LGBTI) people across the African continent.

Uganda

   It's already illegal to be gay in Uganda. If you're found to have had a
   same-sex relationship, you can expect to spend seven years in prison.
   But Uganda's anti-gay laws have become even harsher.

   In December 2013, the notorious Anti-Homosexuality Bill was passed by
   Uganda's Parliament. It has lengthened sentences for consensual
   homosexual sex, and extended punishments to those 'promoting'
   homosexuality.

Nigeria

   Nigeria already outlaws same-sex relationships. But the conditions of
   imprisonment have become wider, and the punishment much harsher, when
   Nigeria's President passed amendments to existing laws in January 2014.

But there are some rays of light...

   Mozambique recently removed the Portuguese colonial-era laws that
   criminalised homosexual behavoir, removing a clause that outlawed
   'vices against nature'.

   But that's only the first step in a long fight for full equality in the
   country. The organisation that successfully lobbied the authorities
   tomake the change, Lambda, is still not officially recognised as an
   NGO.

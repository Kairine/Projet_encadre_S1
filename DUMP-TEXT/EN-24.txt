   As couples in France mark five years on Monday since same-sex marriage
   was made legal with the hashtag #5ansMariagePourTous, ex-president
   François Hollande expressed regret at not having done more to advance
   the rights of “non-traditional” families.

   France’s government voted to pass a bill legalising same-sex marriage
   and adoption on April 23, 2013, after months of intense lobbying for
   and against the legislation. The anti-gay marriage movement, Manif Pour
   Tous (or Protest For All), mounted a fierce campaign against the
   measure, at one point claiming to have drawn 1.4 million people to
   demonstrate in the streets of Paris.

   A little more than a month after the law passed, Vincent Autin and
   Bruno Boileau became the first same-sex couple to wed in France in a
   highly publicised ceremony in the southern city of Montpellier. More
   than 40,000 same-sex couples have since married in France, according to
   the national statistics office Insee.

   Five years on, people across the country have taken to social media to
   celebrate the landmark decision by sharing their own wedding photos.

   “It was a much-discussed reform, and I never thought it would be simple
   to pass,” Hollande, who was president at the time, recalled in an
   interview with BuzzFeed published on Sunday. “It was a parliamentary
   battle, a major political and media battle. But what makes a reform
   interesting isn’t what led to its adoption, but its irreversibility…
   And now, five years later, who really questions marriage equality and
   adoption for same-sex couples?”

   Irène Théry, a sociologist and expert in family affairs, credited the
   law with changing the way people in France view the LGBTQ community.

   “The law on marriage equality… recognised that a same-sex relationship
   could, as a couple, integrate our notion of family and conceptions of
   parenthood. It was an extremely powerful force for integration,” Théry
   told French daily Le Monde.

   “Same-sex couples, married or not, have greater legitimacy today than
   before the law”.

   Battle over assisted reproduction

   Although opposition to same-sex marriage appears to have waned, the
   government has yet to tackle the issues of medically assisted
   reproduction and surrogacy – two points staunchly opposed by social
   conservatives and religious groups.

   Under French law, assisted reproduction is limited to heterosexual
   couples and surrogacy is prohibited. This means that lesbian couples
   and single women who want to have a baby using their own DNA are often
   forced to go abroad for costly procedures.

   Hollande expressed remorse for having failed to fulfill his promise to
   legalise equal access to medically assisted reproduction for
   “nontraditional” families.

   “I regret that we didn’t go in that direction at the end of my term,
   because it’s hypocritical. Sure, lesbian couples are allowed to have
   children, except they’re forced to go to Belgium or Spain, under less
   than ideal or dignified conditions. Because even if our laws recognise
   these children, they do not permit for them to be conceived in France.”

   “When I met women who first thanked me for legalising same-sex marriage
   and adoption, but then told me they had found a solution outside of
   France, I said to myself that I should have taken the next step,” he
   added.

   Hollande said he is opposed to surrogacy on the grounds that it
   “commodifies the body”, but urged women in France to continue the fight
   for equal access to assisted reproduction.

   “It’s inevitable. And even if they don’t have the right, they should
   fight so that future generations might have it,” he said.

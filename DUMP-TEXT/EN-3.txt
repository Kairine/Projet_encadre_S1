Same-sex marriage

   Alternative Titles: same-sex partnership, same-sex union

   Same-sex marriage, the practice of marriage between two men or between
   two women. Although same-sex marriage has been regulated through law,
   religion, and custom in most countries of the world, the legal and
   social responses have ranged from celebration on the one hand to
   criminalization on the other.

   Some scholars, most notably the Yale professor and historian John
   Boswell (1947–94), have argued that same-sex unions were recognized by
   the Roman Catholic Church in medieval Europe, although others have
   disputed this claim. Scholars and the general public became
   increasingly interested in the issue during the late 20th century, a
   period when attitudes toward homosexuality and laws regulating
   homosexual behaviour were liberalized, particularly in western Europe
   and the United States.

   The issue of same-sex marriage frequently sparked emotional and
   political clashes between supporters and opponents. By the early 21st
   century, several jurisdictions, both at the national and subnational
   levels, had legalized same-sex marriage; in other jurisdictions,
   constitutional measures were adopted to prevent same-sex marriages from
   being sanctioned, or laws were enacted that refused to recognize such
   marriages performed elsewhere. That the same act was evaluated so
   differently by various groups indicates its importance as a social
   issue in the early 21st century; it also demonstrates the extent to
   which cultural diversity persisted both within and among countries. For
   tables on same-sex marriage around the world, in the United States, and
   in Australia, see below.

Cultural ideals of marriage and sexual partnership

   Perhaps the earliest systematic analyses of marriage and kinship were
   conducted by the Swiss legal historian Johann Jakob Bachofen (1861) and
   the American ethnologist Lewis Henry Morgan (1871); by the mid-20th
   century an enormous variety of marriage and sexual customs across
   cultures had been documented by such scholars. Notably, they found that
   most cultures expressed an ideal form of marriage and an ideal set of
   marriage partners, while also practicing flexibility in the application
   of those ideals.

   Among the more common forms so documented were common-law marriage;
   morganatic marriage, in which titles and property do not pass to
   children; exchange marriage, in which a sister and a brother from one
   family marry a brother and a sister from another; and group marriages
   based on polygyny (co-wives) or polyandry (co-husbands). Ideal matches
   have included those between cross-cousins, between parallel cousins, to
   a group of sisters (in polygyny) or brothers (in polyandry), or between
   different age sets. In many cultures the exchange of some form of
   surety, such as bride service, bridewealth, or dowry, has been a
   traditional part of the marriage contract.

   Cultures that openly accepted homosexuality, of which there were many,
   generally had nonmarital categories of partnership through which such
   bonds could be expressed and socially regulated. Conversely, other
   cultures essentially denied the existence of same-sex intimacy, or at
   least deemed it an unseemly topic for discussion of any sort.

Religious and secular expectations of marriage and sexuality

   Over time the historical and traditional cultures originally recorded
   by the likes of Bachofen and Morgan slowly succumbed to the
   homogenization imposed by colonialism. Although a multiplicity of
   marriage practices once existed, conquering nations typically forced
   local cultures to conform to colonial belief and administrative
   systems. Whether Egyptian, Vijayanagaran, Roman, Ottoman, Mongol,
   Chinese, European, or other, empires have long fostered (or, in some
   cases, imposed) the widespread adoption of a relatively small number of
   religious and legal systems. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries,
   the perspectives of one or more of the world religions—Buddhism,
   Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity—and their associated civil
   practices were often invoked during national discussions of same-sex
   marriage.

   Perhaps because systems of religion and systems of civil authority
   often reflect and support each other, the countries that had reached
   consensus on the issue by the early 2000s tended to have a single
   dominant religious affiliation across the population; many such places
   had a single, state-sponsored religion. This was the case in both Iran,
   where a strong Muslim theocracy had criminalized same-sex intimacy, and
   Denmark, where the findings of a conference of Evangelical Lutheran
   bishops (representing the state religion) had helped smooth the way for
   the first national recognition of same-sex relationships through
   registered partnerships. In other cases, the cultural homogeneity
   supported by the dominant religion did not result in the application of
   doctrine to the civic realm but may nonetheless have fostered a
   smoother series of discussions among the citizenry: Belgium and Spain
   had legalized same-sex marriage, for instance, despite official
   opposition from their predominant religious institution, the Roman
   Catholic Church.

   The existence of religious pluralities within a country seems to have
   had a less determinate effect on the outcome of same-sex marriage
   debates. In some such countries, including the United States, consensus
   on this issue was difficult to reach. On the other hand, the
   Netherlands—the first country to grant equal marriage rights to
   same-sex couples (2001)—was religiously diverse, as was Canada, which
   did so in 2005.

   Most of the world religions have at some points in their histories
   opposed same-sex marriage for one or more of the following stated
   reasons: homosexual acts violate natural law or divine intentions and
   are therefore immoral; passages in sacred texts condemn homosexual
   acts; and religious tradition recognizes only the marriage of one man
   and one woman as valid. In the early 21st century, however, Judaism,
   Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism all spoke with more than one voice
   on this issue. Orthodox Judaism opposed same-sex marriage, while the
   Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative traditions allowed for it.
   Most Christian denominations opposed it, while the United Church of
   Christ, the United Church of Canada, and the Religious Society of
   Friends (Quakers) took a more favourable stand or allowed individual
   churches autonomy in the matter. The Unitarian Universalist churches
   and the gay-oriented Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community
   Churches fully accepted same-sex marriage. Hinduism, without a sole
   leader or hierarchy, allowed some Hindus to accept the practice while
   others were virulently opposed. The three major schools of
   Buddhism—Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana—stressed the attainment of
   enlightenment as a basic theme; most Buddhist literature therefore
   viewed all marriage as a choice between the two individuals involved.

   Sexuality is but one of many areas where religious and civic authority
   interact; definitions of the purpose of marriage is another. In one
   view, the purpose of marriage is to ensure successful procreation and
   child rearing. In another, marriage provides a—and perhaps
   “the”—fundamental building block of stable communities, with
   procreation as an incidental by-product. A third perspective holds that
   marriage is an instrument of societal domination and so is not
   desirable. A fourth is that relationships between consenting adults
   should not be regulated by the government. Although most religions
   subscribe to just one of these beliefs, it is not uncommon for two or
   more viewpoints to coexist within a given society.

   Proponents of the first view believe that the primary goal of marriage
   is to provide a relatively uniform social institution through which to
   produce and raise children. In their view, because male and female are
   both necessary for procreation, the privileges of marriage should be
   available only to opposite-sex couples. In other words, partnerships
   involving sexual intimacy should have at least a notional potential for
   procreation. From this perspective, the movement to legally recognize
   same-sex marriage is a misguided attempt to deny the social, moral, and
   biological distinctions that foster the continued existence of society
   and so should be discouraged.

   Because this view considers biological reproduction a sort of social
   obligation, its advocates tended to frame individuals’ legal and moral
   commitment to one another as a matter of genetic relatedness. In cases
   of inheritance or custody, for instance, they generally defined the
   parents’ legal duties to their biological children differently than
   those to their stepchildren. Among groups who feel strongly that
   same-sex marriage is problematic, there is also a tendency for the
   legal relationships of spouses, parents, and children to converge.
   Typically, these societies provide for the automatic inheritance of
   property between spouses, and between parents and children, and allow
   these close kin to co-own property without joint ownership contracts.
   In addition, such societies often allow close kin a variety of
   automatic privileges such as sponsoring immigration visas or making
   medical decisions for one another; for those with whom one shares no
   close kin relationship, these privileges typically require legal
   interventions. Such legal circumventions are usually more difficult
   for, and in some cases even prohibited to, same-sex couples.

   In contrast to the procreative model of marriage, advocates of the
   legalization of same-sex marriage generally believed that committed
   partnerships involving sexual intimacy are valuable because they draw
   people together to a singular degree and in singular ways. In this
   view, such relationships are intrinsically worthy while also quite
   distinct from (though not incompatible with) activities associated with
   the bearing or raising of children. Sexual partnerships are one of a
   number of factors that bond adults together into stable household
   units. These households, in turn, form the foundation of a productive
   society—a society in which, albeit incidentally, children, elders, and
   others who may be relatively powerless are likely to be protected.

   From this perspective, the devaluation of same-sex intimacy is immoral
   because it constitutes arbitrary and irrational discrimination, thereby
   damaging the community. Most same-sex marriage advocates further held
   that international human rights legislation provided a universal
   franchise to equal treatment under the law. Thus, prohibiting a
   specific group from the full rights of marriage was illegally
   discriminatory. For advocates of the community-benefit perspective, all
   the legal perquisites associated with heterosexual marriage should be
   available to any committed couple.

   In contrast to these positions, self-identified “queer” theorists and
   activists sought to deconstruct the paired oppositional categories
   common in discussions of biology, gender, and sexuality (e.g.,
   male-female, man-woman, gay-straight) and to replace these with
   categories or continua that they believed better reflect the actual
   practices of humanity. Queer advocates contended that marriage is an
   institution of “hetero-normality” that forces individuals into
   ill-fitting cultural categories and demonizes those who refuse to
   accept those categories. For these reasons, they maintained that
   consensual intimacy between adults should not be regulated and that
   marriage should be disestablished as a cultural institution.

   A fourth view, libertarianism, had different premises from queer theory
   but somewhat similar ramifications; it proposed that government powers
   should be strictly limited, generally to the tasks of maintaining civil
   order, infrastructure, and defense. For libertarians, marriage
   legislation of any sort—either the legalization or the prohibition of
   same-sex marriage—fell outside of the role of government and was
   unacceptable. As a result, many libertarians believed that marriage
   should be “privatized” (i.e., removed from government regulation) and
   that citizens should be able to form partnerships of their choosing.

Same-sex marriage and the law

   Societies have resolved the intertwined issues of sexuality,
   reproduction, and marriage in myriad ways. Their responses regarding
   the morality, desirability, and administrative perquisites of same-sex
   partnerships have been equally diverse. Notably, however, by the
   beginning of the 21st century most countries opted for one of only
   three legal resolutions to these intersecting problems: to ignore
   same-sex partnerships, to criminalize them, or to grant them a status
   similar or equal to that of heterosexual marriage. Many countries have
   yet to reach a consensus on these issues. (See also marriage law.)

   As noted above, many societies traditionally chose to ignore the issue
   of same-sex marriage by treating same-sex intimacy as a subject
   unsuitable for discussion. Many of these jurisdictions, as well as
   those that actively criminalize same-sex unions, contended that
   homosexuality and lesbianism are mental disorders and built their
   public policies on this premise. In treating same-sex desire as a
   psychiatric illness, these cultures moved same-sex intimacy and
   marriage from the realm of civil regulations (the domain of contract
   law) to that of public safety (the domain of criminal law). In such
   societies, the possibility of arrest or institutionalization further
   reinforced taboos on same-sex intimacy and discussions thereof,
   typically driving such activities underground.

International

   In the early 21st century the countries that most seriously penalized
   same-sex relations tended to be in deeply conservative regions of the
   world, particularly Islamic theocracies and some parts of Asia and
   Africa. They often proscribed behaviours that other countries viewed as
   subject to moral, rather than legal, regulation. The judicial systems
   of many predominantly Muslim countries, for instance, invoke Islamic
   law (Sharīʿah) in a wide range of contexts. A variety of sexual or
   quasi-sexual acts, usually including same-sex intimacy, were
   criminalized in these countries, and the penalties for these acts could
   be as severe as execution. However, in a notable show of support for
   transgender individuals in the late 20th century, Iranian Ayatollah
   Ruhollah Khomeini issued a legal decree, or fatwa, supporting
   gender-reassignment surgery when undertaken by individuals who wished
   to “fix” their physiology and thus become heterosexual in the eyes of
   the law.

   In contrast, the acceptance of same-sex partnerships was particularly
   apparent in northern Europe and in countries with cultural ties to that
   region. In 1989 Denmark became the first country to establish
   registered partnerships—an attenuated version of marriage—for same-sex
   couples. Soon thereafter similar laws, generally using specific
   vocabulary (e.g., civil union, civil partnership, domestic partnership,
   registered partnership) to differentiate same-sex unions from
   heterosexual marriages, went into effect in Norway (1993), Sweden
   (1995), Iceland (1996), the Netherlands (1998), and elsewhere in
   Europe, including the United Kingdom (2005) and Ireland (2011).

   Interestingly—and perhaps as a reflection of tensions between the
   marriage-for-procreation and marriage-for-community-good positions
   discussed above—many European countries initially prevented same-sex
   couples from adoption and artificial insemination; by 2007, however,
   most of these restrictions had been removed. Outside Europe, some
   jurisdictions also adopted some form of same-sex partnership rights;
   Israel recognized common-law same-sex marriage in the mid-1990s (the
   Israeli Supreme Court further ruled in 2006 that same-sex marriages
   performed abroad should be recognized), and same-sex civil unions went
   into effect in New Zealand (2005) and in parts of Argentina, Australia,
   Brazil, and Mexico in the early 21st century. In 2007 Uruguay became
   the first Latin American country to legalize same-sex civil unions
   nationwide; the legislation became effective the following year.

   Some jurisdictions opted to specifically apply the honorific of
   “marriage” to same-sex as well as heterosexual unions. In 2000 the
   Netherlands revised its same-sex partnership law and the following year
   became the first country to offer marriage to same-sex couples; several
   other European countries subsequently legalized gay marriage. In 2003
   the European Union mandated that all of its members pass laws
   recognizing the same-sex marriages of fellow EU countries. As countries
   began to legalize same-sex partnerships, public opinion, particularly
   in Europe, began to shift in favour of full marriage rights for
   same-sex unions. For example, by the middle of the first decade of the
   2000s, a Eurobarometer poll (carried out by the European Commission)
   found that four-fifths of the citizens of the Netherlands felt that
   same-sex marriage should be legal throughout Europe; in a further seven
   countries (Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Germany, and
   the Czech Republic), a majority held a similar view. Nevertheless, in
   other parts of Europe, particularly central and southern Europe,
   support for same-sex marriage was quite low, often with fewer than
   one-fifth of those polled favouring legalization. By the following
   decade, polls indicated that roughly one-half of British citizens
   approved of legalizing same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom; such
   marriages were legalized in England and Wales in 2013, and Scotland
   followed suit in 2014.

   In 2005 Canada became the first country outside Europe to pass
   legislation legalizing same-sex marriage. Thereafter, South Africa
   (2006) and Argentina (2010) were the first African and Latin American
   countries, respectively, to legalize same-sex marriage. New Zealand
   (2013) became the first country in Oceania to do so. Elsewhere, Bermuda
   legalized same-sex marriage in 2017, but the following year it passed a
   bill that replaced such marriages with domestic partnerships. Bermuda
   thus became the first country to repeal same-sex marriage.

   In other countries, decisions on same-sex marriage were effectively
   turned over to individual states or districts. In 2009 the Federal
   District (Mexico City), separate from other Mexican jurisdictions,
   legalized same-sex marriage. Soon after the law went into effect in
   2010, Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that it was constitutional and that
   all states in the country had to recognize same-sex marriages performed
   in Mexico City. Gay marriage was later made legal, under the same
   terms, elsewhere in the country. Similarly, shortly after Brazil
   legalized same-sex civil unions in 2011, the Supreme Federal Court
   ruled that sexual orientation could not be a pretext for denying a
   couple the legal protections of marriage, although it stopped short of
   specifically authorizing same-sex marriage at the federal level. In
   response, several Brazilian states separately opted to allow for
   same-sex marriages, which were considered valid throughout Brazil,
   before the National Council of Justice approved a resolution in 2013
   ensuring that such unions could be registered anywhere in the country.
   Also in 2013, the Australian Capital Territory became the first
   jurisdiction in Australia to pass a law permitting the marriage of
   same-sex couples, although Australia’s High Court later struck down the
   law within days of its having taken effect. In 2017 a majority of
   Australians voted for same-sex marriage in a nonbinding referendum.
   Shortly thereafter the country’s Parliament passed legislation
   legalizing same-sex marriage, and it was signed into law in December
   2017.

United States

   In the United States the question of whether couples of the same sex
   should be allowed to marry has roiled politics since at least 1993. In
   that year the Supreme Court of Hawaii heard a case in which the
   plaintiffs claimed that the state’s refusal to issue marriage licenses
   to same-sex couples abrogated those individuals’ rights to equal
   treatment under the law. The state, in turn, argued that it had a
   compelling interest in preventing same-sex marriage, as that practice
   would inherently damage the public good. The court found for the
   plaintiffs, basing its argument on the law’s absence of a clear
   definition of who might or might not participate in such a partnership.
   Soon after this finding, Hawaiian legislators added such a definition
   to the state constitution and thus made moot the issuing of marriage
   licenses to same-sex partners.

   Many Americans felt that the Hawaii court decision represented a
   serious threat to social stability, and in 1996 the U.S. Congress
   enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This legislation declared
   that same-sex marriages would not be recognized for federal purposes,
   such as the award of Social Security benefits normally afforded to a
   surviving spouse or employment-based benefits for the partners of
   federal employees. The act also restated existing law by providing that
   no U.S. state or territory was required to recognize marriages from
   elsewhere when it had strong policies to the contrary. Within a decade
   of the federal act’s passage, almost all the states had enacted laws or
   constitutional amendments declaring variously that marriage was legally
   defined as a heterosexual institution, that same-sex marriages from
   other states would not be recognized, or that same-sex marriage was
   contrary to the public policies of the state.

   Nonetheless, some states moved toward the legal recognition of same-sex
   partnerships. In 1999 the Vermont Supreme Court declared that same-sex
   couples were entitled under the state constitution to the same legal
   rights as married heterosexual couples; shortly thereafter the state
   legislature enacted a law creating “civil unions,” which conferred all
   the rights and responsibilities of marriage but not the name. In 2003
   California enacted a similar statute, calling the relationships
   “domestic partnerships.”

   Also in 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the denial of
   marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated the state constitution;
   the court gave the state six months to comply with its order to remedy
   the situation. The state soon began to issue marriage licenses for
   same-sex couples, but these were quickly challenged and their legal
   status over the long term remained uncertain. Officials in some smaller
   jurisdictions, notably San Francisco, joined the controversy in early
   2004 by issuing marriage licenses in defiance of local prohibitions;
   these licenses were later found to be invalid. Subsequently, several
   other states and Washington, D.C., either established same-sex civil
   unions or adopted jurisdictionwide policies that accorded some spousal
   rights to same-sex couples.

   Early in 2008 the Supreme Courts of two states—California and
   Connecticut—struck down state laws limiting marriage to the union
   between a man and a woman. Later in 2008 the voters in California
   passed a referendum, Proposition 8, that defined marriage as a union
   between a man and a woman. Proposition 8 subsequently was ruled
   unconstitutional in federal district court in August 2010 on the
   grounds that the prohibition of same-sex marriage violated the due
   process and equal protection clauses. Although advocates of the
   referendum quickly sought to contest the decision, it was upheld by a
   federal appeals court in February 2012. Referenda similar to
   California’s Proposition 8 were approved in Arizona and Florida in 2008
   and in North Carolina in 2012.

   In April 2009 the Iowa Supreme Court overturned a state law that barred
   gay marriage, and soon afterward the legislatures of Vermont, Maine,
   and New Hampshire legalized same-sex marriage—though in November 2009
   Maine voters repealed the law. By 2011 Washington, D.C., and New York
   state had enacted similar legislation. In early 2012 bills allowing for
   same-sex marriage were passed by legislatures in Maryland and
   Washington state. Subsequent challenges to the laws made their
   implementation contingent on the results of ballot referenda, and in
   November voters in both states affirmed the laws. As the electorate in
   Maine simultaneously reversed its previous decision, the three states
   became the first in the country to approve same-sex marriage at the
   ballot box.

   Broadly reflecting the community-benefit rhetoric noted above, many
   American legal scholars and same-sex marriage advocates developed
   arguments that the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution
   guaranteed the fundamental right to marry. Opposition arguments broadly
   reflected the procreative position and frequently invoked biblical
   exegeses or other religious doctrine to support claims that marriage,
   strictly defined, should be available only to heterosexual couples.
   Advocates of both perspectives cited various and conflicting
   sociological studies in defense of their claims. At the beginning of
   the 21st century a clear majority of the U.S. population opposed
   same-sex marriage, but by 2010 about half of the population supported
   legalization, and many of those opposed were open to the creation of
   legally recognized partnerships for same-sex couples.

   In 2012, as public debate on the issue persisted, two significant
   events occurred at the federal level. Pres. Barack Obama, who during
   his initial years in office had endorsed only civil unions for same-sex
   couples, in May became the first sitting U.S. president to publicly
   support same-sex marriage. In December the U.S. Supreme Court announced
   that it would hear challenges to DOMA and to Proposition 8. The
   following year the court declared DOMA to be unconstitutional “as a
   deprivation of the equal liberty of persons that is protected by the
   Fifth Amendment,” and it vacated the appeals court’s ruling regarding
   Proposition 8 on the grounds that the law’s defenders (a group of
   private citizens) lacked standing to appeal the district court’s order.

   Between December 2013 and August 2014, federal judges in 14 states
   overturned state bans of same-sex marriage. In all but two of those
   states, the rulings were stayed, although some of the states briefly
   performed same-sex marriages prior to their suspension. U.S. Attorney
   General Eric Holder announced that those marriages would be recognized
   by the federal government, and in February 2014 he introduced a
   Department of Justice policy to grant equal protection and treatment to
   all lawful marriages in the United States. In October the U.S. Supreme
   Court declined to review appeals of federal court decisions in five
   states, which effectively made same-sex marriage legal in those
   jurisdictions. As an indirect consequence, same-sex marriage was soon
   legalized by U.S. district courts in several additional states. By the
   end of 2014, the number of states where such marriages were legal had
   reached 35—more than twice as many as at the beginning of the year.

   In January 2015 the Supreme Court agreed to review a November 2014
   decision of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit that had upheld
   state laws and constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage or
   the recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions.
   In June, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the court reversed both of the Sixth
   Circuit’s holdings, thereby legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50
   states.

The future of same-sex marriage

   At the turn of the 21st century it was clear that the evolution of
   rights for same-sex couples depended to a great extent upon the
   interplay of a country’s institutional forces. In parliamentary unitary
   systems, such as those of the Netherlands, Spain, and the United
   Kingdom, for example, legislatures (and the executives derived from
   them) were instrumental in the success or failure of such laws. In
   other countries, particularly those with federal political systems and
   strong judiciaries, such as Canada, South Africa, and the United
   States, the courts played a vital role. For yet another group of
   polities, such as Switzerland and many U.S. states, institutional rules
   enabled voters to take a direct role in the passage or rejection of
   legislation.

   In countries where consensus has yet to be reached on this issue, the
   debate is unlikely to be resolved quickly or easily. In some parts of
   the world, such as those plagued by war or natural disasters, same-sex
   marriage is simply not an urgent matter. In others, the broad spectrum
   of notions about sexuality and the purpose of marriage is compounded by
   national pluralism and a tendency for secularism and religiosity to
   intersect in complex and unexpected ways.

   it easier for us to review and, hopefully, publish your contribution by
   keeping a few points in mind.
    1. Encyclopædia Britannica articles are written in a neutral objective
       tone for a general audience.
    2. You may find it helpful to search within the site to see how

    4. At the bottom of the article, feel free to list any sources that
       support your changes, so that we can fully understand their
       context. (Internet URLs are the best.)

   Your contribution may be further edited by our staff, and its
   publication is subject to our final approval. Unfortunately, our
   editorial approach may not be able to accommodate all contributions.

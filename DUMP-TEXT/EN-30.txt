   Issues About Same Sex Marriage
   Same sex marriage rights have been a very controversial issue in both
   political and religious circles. While same sex marriage is seen in
   early history, the debate for gay marriage rights has become a very
   heated debate. Same sex marriages were first legalized in the
   Netherlands and Massachusetts was the first US state to allow for
   legally legally recognized same sex marriages.
   In fact, less than ten countries or US states recognize same sex
   marriage. Many religious leaders continue to speak out in staunch
   opposition to conferring marriage rights to same sex couples. In fact
   the Catholic church is still very much opposed to same sex marriages.
   In addition, conservatives are opponents of defining same sex
   relationships as marriages. However, Democrats generally support same
   sex marriages, domestic partnerships or civil unions.
   Many opponents of gay marriage are also against same sex couples
   raising children. In fact, the opposition generally quotes outdated
   studies that show detrimental effects on children raised by same sex
   couples. However, recent studies suggest that children raised by same
   sex couples, are likely to grow up to be well adjusted and happy
   individuals. The opposition to LGBT rights, can be extremely
   detrimental to individuals and to society as a whole.
   For instance, same sex couples that are not able to wed, are more
   likely to suffer from sexually transmitted diseases, depression and
   suicidal tendencies.  In contrast, same sex couples that are able to
   wed, enjoy better over all health and well being and are able to
   contribute to society in a productive manner.
   The debate about same sex marriage rights, has greatly effected the
   political and social climate in this country. In fact, members of the
   LGBT community have become extremely active in political forums.  Many
   politicians have declined to offer opinions on allowing or prohibiting
   gay marriage or adoption. In fact, politicians often fail to take a
   stance on the subject because of the attached controversy.
   However, states like Florida have explicitly denied gay adoption
   rights, in part because same sex couples are legally forbidden from
   marrying in the state. Again, studies suggest that children raised by
   same sex couples, become productive members of society and suffer no
   ill effects from being raised by same sex couples. In America, around
   sixty percent of citizens are supportive of some type of legal
   recognition of the relationship between same sex couples.
   In general however, many people believe that marriage should continue
   to be defined as a unique union of one man and one woman. However, most
   people believe that couples in domestic partnerships or civil unions,
   should be entitled to the same rights and responsibilities generally
   conferred on marriages.  In fact, trends suggest much greater support
   for the rights of the LGBT community, including the ability to
   criminally prosecute individuals that commit hate crimes against people
   based on sexual orientation or gender association. However,
   transsexuals and transgender individuals are currently offered the
   least protection from discrimination and hate crimes. In fact, most
   states offer no legal recourse for such actions.
   Yet, many transsexuals and transgender individuals have been able to
   get married, due to loopholes in laws that do not state at which point
   an individual must be of a certain gender. Lawmakers have begun to
   address issue of discrimination, hate crimes and rights for the LGBT
   community, including the right to have their relationship legally
   recognized.
   Some states have recently legalized same sex weddings in addition to
   passing hate crime and discrimination legislation that includes
   criminal penalties for those that break the law. However, other states
   have passed legislation that explicitly bans legal recognition for any
   same sex relationships in addition to preventing the passage of
   legislation that prohibits discrimination or hate crimes against the
   LGBT community.
   In addition, other countries have begun to address issues that effect
   the LGBT community. In fact, same sex couples have recently been
   allowed to be legally married in  Mexico. In addition, transgender
   individuals are allowed to marry in Singapore as long as the couple is
   opposite sex. In contrast, some countries have passed laws that
   explicitly forbid same sex marriage.  It appears that the Federal
   government in this country will be forced to address all of these
   issues on a national level.
   In fact, they will either have to prohibit or allow legal same sex
   marriages, in order to avoid the continued nationwide conflict on the
   subject. Currently, states have the power to decide the issues for
   themselves. While some states enacted the Defense of Marriage Act,
   others have not explicitly forbidden the legal recognition of same sex
   marriage, but they have also not allowed it as of yet. Politics has a
   lot to do with each state's stance on same sex marriage. Generally,
   lawmakers in conservative states, push for the enactment of DOMA, as
   well as further laws that prohibit the legal recognition of same sex
   marriage.
   In addition, many churches have taken an active stance against LGBT
   rights including the right to recognize any relationship between same
   sex couples. While Liberal states often enact laws that protect the
   rights of the LGBT community, including the right to marry. In
   addition, there are currently many reform movements that seek to enact
   progressive, but steady change in the LGBT movement. For example, the
   Jewish Reform movement has recognized the rights of the LGBT community,
   including the right to marry. Reform movements have been effective in
   bringing attention to the many issues that effect the LGBT community.

Taiwan still divided on gay marriage, says President Tsai Ing-wen

   Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has openly supported the legalisation of
   gay marriage, but her majority government has been accused of dragging
   its feet on implementing the change.

   TAIPEI (AFP) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen remained non-committal on
   Monday (June 25) on whether her government will actively push for quick
   implementation of a landmark court ruling last year which paved the way
   for same-sex couples to marry.

   Taiwan's top court in May 2017 legalised gay marriage - the first place
   in Asia to do so - and ruled its decision must be implemented within
   two years.

   Should the government fail to approve legislation within the deadline,
   the court ordered that gay marriage automatically become legal anyway.

   Campaigners were hoping Ms Tsai would help press for a decision in
   Parliament ahead of the two-year mark, but couples are still waiting to
   tie the knot over a year after the court ruling.

   In an interview with AFP on Monday, when asked if she would push the
   issue, Ms Tsai said the government would "bridge the differences
   society holds on this issue in order to propose a comprehensive Bill".

   She cast the issue as dividing generations in Taiwan.

   "Same-sex marriage is also a reflection of the generational gap. In
   Taiwan, those above 40 tend to have different views to those under 40,"
   she told AFP.

   Participants react as they take part in a lesbian, gay, bisexual and
   transgender (LGBT) pride parade in Taipei, Taiwan, on Oct 28, 2017.

legalised

   Conservative groups have staged mass protests against legalising
   same-sex unions and have accused the courts of bypassing the government
   on the issue.

   Ms Tsai described the court ruling as "one phase" of the reform and
   said the government must abide by its decision.

   Taiwan is seen as one of the most progressive societies in Asia when it
   comes to gay rights, and it stages the biggest gay pride parade in Asia
   annually.

   Ms Tsai has openly supported the legalisation of gay marriage, but
   since last year's decision by the constitutional court, her majority
   government has been accused of dragging its feet on implementing the
   change.

   The ruling said the island's current laws preventing same-sex unions
   violate the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of marriage and
   equality, a move welcomed by activists around the world.
